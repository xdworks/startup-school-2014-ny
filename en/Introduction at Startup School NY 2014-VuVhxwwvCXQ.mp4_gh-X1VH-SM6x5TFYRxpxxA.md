**Introduction at Startup School NY 2014-VuVhxwwvCXQ.mp4**  \[00:00:01\] Hi everybody.

You all realize this is the first start of school here.

And the amazing one of a kind unparallelled New York City.

It\'s exciting.

 \[00:00:12\] Yes.

 \[00:00:14\] This is the city that made me.

I\'m from Brooklyn anyone from Brooklyn here.

So I expected that lots of good broken toys.

Any anyone here from the Bronx.

 \[00:00:24\] Bronx represent.

That\'s good loud and proud.

How about queens.

 \[00:00:29\] Who has been going to work Queens tech showed up.

And how about Staten Island.

That\'s what Noel everand probably a few of you from Manhattan as well the idea.

The easiest.

Nice where those boos in Brooklyn when we know we know Brooklyn\'s the best borough.

We don\'t need to rub it in their faces.

We get in trouble.

There\'s a bunch of people here though who aren\'t even from New York City.

You\'ve traveled quite a ways to be here.

I make some noise your.

Yes.

Thank you.

Thank you for coming I hope you have a wonderful time here in New York.

 \[00:01:03\] As you can see it\'s another beautiful summer day in New York City very mild temperate you know.

I love it here though I really do.

And the first start of school is jism Y Combinator history that was up in Boston and I was lucky enough to participate in it.

My co-founder and I Steve Hoffman I\'m Alexa\'s my co-founder and I Steve started Reddit and we were at the very first start of school and trust me Hawai see was just begging people to come and show up.

This was such a new thing this new idea.

Back in 0 5 about helping you know early stage founders just get insight from their peers from people who are doing it and have done it in a way that was approachable in a way that was helpful and in a room full of people who are all actually doing great stuff.

We don\'t want to have seen stories we don\'t want to have people who are just sort of talking about doing startups who want to be with people who are doing it and so know that you\'re in a really special audience right now right.

Everyone around you look to your left to your right during all the breaks.

These are all people doing cool stuff.

So please take advantage of the discussions you\'ll have here during the intermissions just as much as you\'ll enjoy the talks you\'ll hear on stage.

This is exciting and I know I know a lot of you have decided to come out in spite of the fact the World Cup is going on right now which is important I wonder about your priorities.

But clearly the right kind of founders and just so you know I think Chilla is still up on Spain 1 0.

I don\'t know how you guys feel about that.

Rezvan upset some very happy Shawlands here but we\'ll see what happens.

But look I just wanted to point out one of the thing you know we\'re also like you have to have I think it\'s there are now 28 Y Combinator companies that are based here in New York.

And this is kind of exciting we\'ve got companies let\'s see here we gotta anarchist hacker school one month rails valuable rant hop we\'ve Rockett trip and I think Teek on US year from Passon scribbles.

These are all members of the Lycee family who spent three months out in the valley.

They worked on their company as they did why they took advantage of all the sort of Silicon Valley Network and then they came back here to grow their companies and that is awesome because obviously our food is better because obviously the quality of life here is better and because obviously this is one of the greatest cities in the world.

And so I\'m happy you guys are all here.

I\'m still happy Startup School is here and I hope the rest of this afternoon is viable and entertaining for you all as I know it will be for me.

And so you know I have one other thing that I wanted to mention and this is something I made sure I got my notes here yep this is something that I cannot stress enough.

I\'ve just gotten done in 80 university tour across the country.

All right I got to visit 80 universities and Canada Arhat to the north.

Yes Canada and I\'ve seen first hand the fact that entrepreneurship is alive and well and students are taking it upon themselves to just start building and start learning and start coding and this is crazy to me because nine years ago I would have killed for any ounce of this kind of energy.

Back when I was just an undergrad at UVA getting Reddit started and I can assure you some people here in this audience are going to go on to do amazing world changing things so be nice to everyone but also take full advantage of this moment.

We are so lucky to be talking about this stuff right.

We are so lucky to be sitting in a nice air conditioned auditorium talking about these amazing opportunities we have because of the new economy because of technology and because if you want to change the world you know in the internet age you don\'t need open a factory you just need to open a laptop.

Right.

That\'s a really big deal and we\'re really lucky to be here taking advantage of it.
