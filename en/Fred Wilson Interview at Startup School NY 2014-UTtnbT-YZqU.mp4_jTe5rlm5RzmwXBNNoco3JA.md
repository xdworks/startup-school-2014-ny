**Fred Wilson Interview at Startup School NY 2014-UTtnbT-YZqU.mp4**  \[00:00:00\] Hi everyone.

Good afternoon.

My name\'s Aaron Harris.

I\'m a partner at Y Combinator and before I was a partner at Y C I founded a company called tutor\'s spree that went through Y Combinator in the winter of 2011 and today it\'s my honor to introduce someone who doesn\'t really need very much of an introduction but I\'ll do it anyway.

Fred Wilson has been investing in technology for close to 30 years and in that time he\'s founded two separate DC firms the first one flat iron partners was founded in 2000 in 1996 and the second Union Square Ventures was founded in 2004.

Without a doubt Fred is one of the best known investors on the East Coast and he\'s one of the premier consumer technology investors in the world.

He\'s also created through his blog AVC a lively community which is home to wide ranging discussions about finance technology government and his taste in music.

You all join me in welcoming Fred Wilson.

 \[00:01:09\] So that was obviously eye right.

I think so.

So that was a great talk by Shannah.

You know what I love about Shana.

She has opinions and she\'s not afraid to share them.

And that\'s what makes great investors.

I think investors need conviction and she\'s got conviction.

 \[00:01:26\] What would seem like if you were waffling on each of your investment decisions you\'d never really reach anything.

 \[00:01:31\] There\'s a lot of people in the venture business who hedge and follow and you know try to figure out what the hot thing is and don\'t have like a like a you know kind of their own opinions.

I don\'t buy I don\'t agree with I probably don\'t agree with half of what Shannah said.

But like we argue about these things but I appreciate that.

Like she\'s probably write a bunch of places where I\'m wrong.

I might be right in a few places where she\'s wrong but that\'s okay.

That\'s why I think investors need to have that.

And entrepreneurs sometimes get annoyed because they walk into a meeting and they\'re meeting with you and they\'re like chicest just not buying this at all you know.

But you know better than I think pitching to someone who is just like you know next to nothing and they are pretty awful.

 \[00:02:17\] You know it\'s interesting I guess if all the investors agreed with each other prices would rise infinitely and no deals would actually get done.

At the end of the day know sitting in the room with an investor with someone who comes to you with a patch you know what\'s going to make you decide that you believe in what they\'re doing versus saying you know it this isn\'t really going to work.

What are you looking for.

 \[00:02:36\] Well we have opinions.

Right.

So it sort of goes back to what you\'re saying much it we have certain opinions about what\'s interesting to us so we come into the meeting with a preconceived notion about what we\'re looking for.

What\'s exciting to us what\'s not exciting to us.

So part of it is is just that that entrepreneur is connecting to some preconceived notion that we already have.

I mean I remember back when Brad and I were raising the first USV funded 2003.

He said to me why isn\'t there a Google for jobs instead of having to go to Hot Jobs or Craigslist or monster like why can\'t you just go to someplace and search and just have every job posting on the entire internet like filtered for you.

 \[00:03:21\] And I was like a good idea.

 \[00:03:23\] And then and then one day I was with my friend John motel\'s blog and he he mentioned this company had launched called indeed and I was like Brad that\'s the thing you\'ve been looking for.

And we called them up we\'re like let us invest.

Though no one talked to these CEOs to call on them keep calling them and eventually you know at five times the valuation that we originally thought we were going to pay we did get to invest.

 \[00:03:47\] So that\'s interesting.

I mean that\'s that\'s an example of a specific idea you had in mind a specific company that you want to see for.

Right.

Is that typical of how you make investments or is it more thematic.

 \[00:03:57\] No that\'s rare.

Like we\'re entrepreneurs the ones who generally come up with the great ideas and we react to them.

So it\'s generally more sort of thematic.

That we just have certain ideas about what\'s coming and given that that\'s coming.

This should happen and boy so we should look for that thing.

And sometimes these ideas are sort of half baked and not fully formed and then an entrepreneur comes in and you\'re like yeah yeah that\'s what it was thinking about but they\'ve kind of crystallized it way more because they obviously thought way more about like when you\'re when you\'re building a company you\'re doing one thing like you become obsessed about that one thing and you get really deep into it and you generally understand that opportunity better than an investor will.

 \[00:04:50\] So this is actually something pretty interesting that you\'re touching on which is something we talk about a lot.

When we look at applications which is the ability of the founder to communicate his ideas or her ideas clearly and well it\'s so critical because there are a lot of people who probably have thought about these things very deeply.

What do you think it is that that drives certain people to be able to communicate that.

Or what do you react to in terms of that communication and that clarity that that stands out.

Well you know this is.

 \[00:05:18\] I think this is true of a lot of investors.

I like it when somebody can explain something very crisply and very simply and so in they and they get you to the sort of nugget of what they\'re doing right away.

I mean not not by rushing into it by but by just kind of simplifying it and making it easy to understand.

And I think that some people are born with that gift.

 \[00:05:51\] Other people I think can develop it.

I have worked on that myself over the years and I\'ve found that I\'ve gotten better and better and better at that and I do that a lot of times for our portfolio companies when it\'s the next round or maybe the decided they want to sell and so we get involved in helping them do that.

And I have found that I\'ve gotten good at.

 \[00:06:13\] Positioning the opportunity quickly in a way that\'s very hopefully attractive to the person on the other end of the phone or whatever.

But that\'s that\'s really really important skill is to be able to explain what you\'re doing.

And I think without buzz words.

Because it\'s so easy to fall back on buzz words or three letter acronyms CRM or something like that and people\'s eyes tend to glaze over.

I think it\'s it\'s another temptation.

People have sometimes is to say I\'m the x for x you know I\'m you know ETSI for electronics or I\'m uber for helicopters or whatever.

And and you know that\'s a really good in some ways a really great technique.

But it also sometimes trivializes what you\'re doing.

Right.

So but but I think being able to communicate crisply and clearly is really important.

 \[00:07:09\] It\'s interesting that you mention the vest for that thing.

When we when we applied to Y Combinator was judiciary we pitched ourselves as the Air B and B for tutor\'s.

Right.

And part of the reason we did that was it allowed us to pack a lot of information into a very short sentence.

Turns out we were totally wrong.

We were not the urban bee for tutor\'s it was it was not the right way to look at the business.

 \[00:07:28\] When you say when you came in and said we\'re air B and B for tutor\'s.

 \[00:07:31\] Great.

That\'s interesting.

Yeah.

No he he was into that is like who Airblue and I mean this is this is so he responds well to that he did it he did in that case.

 \[00:07:41\] It was interesting I think that he was looking at us as a founding team and then thinking about what could happen next in the company and air being Betis four years ago was certainly growing quickly.

Had already turned them down.

 \[00:07:53\] Thank you for that.

But they were certainly Helfgot an open wound right here.

You want to pour some money on it.

I mean you\'ve got to bring it.

I\'m not here to stay out of it.

But you know it\'s funny.

I think what you just said about.

You said.

Something about.

 \[00:08:09\] The the team was good and the potential of what they could do with the idea.

Right.

I think that\'s what seed investors are good at.

Yes seed investors are really good at connecting to the potential of the team and the potential of the big idea and not getting caught up in much more than that.

We we sometimes invest in seed rounds but usually those are seed rounds for companies that have already shipped a product.

I think we this is a criticism or maybe just an observation of USV.

We\'re actually not very good at the thing you just said that seat investors do.

I think we\'re very good at.

Evaluating a team once they\'ve created a product.

So I see Zach Sims just walked in back there and when Zack and Ryan chip code academy you know we were able to say oh fuck that\'s a maze like we need to invest in this right.

We also knew Zack and Ryan we knew how great they were because we were hanging around Columbia University trying to find interesting teams coming out of there.

But so it was the potential of the team on top of something that they already shipped into the market right.

And I think that\'s what we\'re good at.

And I think that great seed investors don\'t need to see.

The product they they somehow can recognize the potential in the people that they are going to create that product.

 \[00:09:33\] And I think we would find that hard to do now Codecademy is a pretty interesting example of that because when they launched it old and working on it for a few weeks it launched.

I mean it\'s an unduly nailed it.

They know the traction is huge immediately right.

So when you compare that against other you know Chenowith saying you know do something different.

 \[00:09:51\] I think they were the first people to do in browser you know like writing code in browser as a way to teach coding.

I think so.

Is that right.

We the first yes.

He claims that they were.

So I don\'t know who to believe everything he says.

But that was a unique tweak on the idea of how do you teach someone to code.

And so that.

That I think was was part of why they kind of just took off because it was inviting to people.

Oh I can do this.

So when you\'re looking at that sort of take off moment.

 \[00:10:28\] What metrics are you looking at is there a specific set of things you\'re analyzing or is it just a general momentum somewhere.

 \[00:10:33\] We don\'t have like a number of people always say to be how many how many monthly active users do I need before you\'re going to invest in my company.

Was like I have no idea.

It\'s more sort of it\'s it\'s more sort of.

Based on.

The market.

The product.

What you would expect for a product like that.

Certain things that are you know super viral you\'d want to see much larger numbers things that are more utilities smaller numbers but you know the right kinds of engagement might might be more important niche services that have sort of high value niches maybe it\'s even smaller numbers but just so it\'s a we don\'t have a formula.

We don\'t like an algorithm or anything like that.

We\'ve toyed around with my partner Albert is enamored of this idea.

Moneyball for EVC.

Could we create an algorithm and just set centrally like crawl the Internet and run algorithms and then I\'ll just tell us what companies to invest in.

I don\'t think it\'s that simple.

I think it\'s a little bit more art than science.

 \[00:11:48\] What\'s most likely to trick you on that decision.

 \[00:11:58\] Well a good example is turntable.

It\'s a turntable was a monster right at the gate.

It ended up not working.

And so their problem was that they did churn problem.

But their.

Acquisition was so high in the early days that you couldn\'t really see the churn unless you really knew how to look for it.

But over time the churn revealed itself and.

Then it just could never get beyond that.

And I think that the churn was related to the fact that the that a lot of people listen to music in a very passive sort of way like they take a software engineer or they go into work they put on their music they put on their headphones and grinding when they don\'t actually want to be like in a room engaging with people around the music right.

So it was too intense.

And people just had they like I got to get off of this I got to go back to Pinda or whatever else I\'m listening to.

So that was what I think cause.

But so we got Hedvig on that one.

 \[00:12:58\] Would you make the same kind of bet again.

There is a huge amount of momentum behind that.

 \[00:13:02\] I think the real well you know but also the soaped.

Let\'s unpack that a little bit more.

I\'d known Billy for six years and I know Seth for close to.

Well 15 to 20 years.

So was a team meeting really well and they had this super hot property.

And so it was kind of a combination.

I\'ve been looking to invest in one of these projects for a long time because I always had recognized his talent.

So it was kind of it was like the perfect storm of.

I liked the people.

There\'s a.

There\'s a product centric entrepeneur here who I\'ve always respect and wanted to work with.

And now if they Dave Neil what they\'ve hit it.

So maybe the fact that the people side of the equation was.

Was so strong for me meant that I was willing to kind of maybe not.

Be as.

Diligent in the analysis of the phenomena.

 \[00:14:00\] When you\'ve made that decision right when you\'ve made the decision to invest in a company is really calling me a B round.

What are you expecting people to go and do once they have your money in their bank.

 \[00:14:12\] Well at its core I think doing a startup is building business.

So I think that what I would want them to do is get on with the building of a business and wrote a blog post today about the metaphore of going up a flight of stairs and step one is building the product and getting the product market fit step in.

That\'s.

Generally what I think of seed money for.

And then.

Getting you know getting a series a done so that you can go beyond the founding team which might be two or three or four people and go out and build sort of a 10 or 12 or 14 person team to really.

You know get you know all of the aspects of the business going really create sustainable growth and really continue invest in product and then once you\'ve proven you can do that series B would be around building full blown business scaling the team taking the market becoming the dominant product in the market and then Series C get to profitability.

And then after that take the company public sell it to a secondary.

So each of those steps along the way is ultimately in furtherance of building a company building a real business.

And so I see it sort of as a as a just a march through those those parts and I want to see people commit to making the investments in the business that are required to make all those things happen.

So it\'s it\'s usually about you know continue to invest in product and build out a team get to a business model execute their business model get revenues get customers.

Continue to build the team and.

If the entrepreneur either gets unfocused and.

Like.

Starts.

Lighting up a whole bunch of side projects or is reluctant to build a team or there\'s some.

Kind of classic red flag you get some times when you start to see that there for whatever reason not really kind of committed to.

That.

Sort of grinding away on the business that I think has got to do.

 \[00:16:28\] You\'ve been watching companies raise money and spend money for 30 years.

 \[00:16:33\] There\'s been a lot of talk about how starting a startup is easier than ever Alexa\'s mentioned all you all you need to do now is open your laptop to be less cost or have gone down remarkably.

But see brands are getting larger and larger.

Right.

So many things going on there.

 \[00:16:50\] I think it\'s just a function that there\'s a lot of demand from investors.

You know everything from angel investor seed investors sees in lots of other types to put money into startups.

And so I think entrepreneurs are in a.

You know in a in a market in a sellers market where they can raise a lot of capital and.

A lot of entrepreneurs are choosing to do that because they equate capital with runway and run away with increasing the probability of success.

But I think that\'s a little bit of a trap because I think that with a limited amount of money to too little money will kill you and too much money will kill you with a limited amount of money.

If it\'s sufficient it focuses you and constrains all of the possible things you might do and makes you and your cofounders.

Make the hard decisions about do we do this or do we do this we can\'t do both.

We have to pick one let\'s do this.

It forces you into this kind of process about optimizing the most important things and doing the things that are going to get you to where you want to go.

And I really really like that.

So I I I think that.

The market is.

At a stage right now where you wish you could go out and do it two and a half million dollars seed.

I\'m generally I would generally advise founders not to do that given the low interest rate environment.

 \[00:18:21\] The fact that doesn\'t seem to be ending any time soon where rent growth and inflation are you can reasonably assume that that kind of capital interaction is going to go on for quite some time.

So as an investor looking a little bit later.

Are you at all worried that the traditional size of the rounds and the prices that you pay for rounds are just going to get to a place where it doesn\'t make sense for you anymore.

Well I mean.

If you look at that know we\'ve beenU.S.

vs 10 years old this year and if you look at the prices we were paying for seeds and series A\'s in 2004 2005 2006.

That was here and then in 2007 8 2000.

 \[00:18:59\] 2007 2008 2009 that was here and then in 2010 2011 2012 it was here and now it\'s like here right.

So it just keeps going up and.

You know we have reacted to that by.

I think making some changes.

We become more willing to invest in places like Iowa and Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Berlin and.

 \[00:19:31\] Other parts of Europe.

 \[00:19:33\] And so that\'s going to where the supply demand equation is not quite as in favor of entrepreneurs as as it is in Silicon Valley in New York.

And increasingly other parts the United States so.

 \[00:19:48\] That\'s one thing we\'ve done.

We\'ve got a little bit more picky.

OK.

 \[00:19:52\] If we\'re going to pay those prices then damn well be you know you know risk reward equation that were we\'re happy with so maybe we want to see a little bit more traction or want a really up super high quality team.

 \[00:20:07\] So that\'s how we\'ve managed it.

I guess it could get to the point where we think we\'re not going to make money but we don\'t see any hints maybe maybe even series have been mispriced for 25 years.

And maybe the market\'s finally starting to price them correctly.

 \[00:20:21\] When you think about the seed investment is basically a very long long option.

Right.

Where it\'s EDAR worth a hundred a thousand acts or it\'s worth nothing.

You could argue it\'s worth a lot more than people paid for it in the past and maybe that is what we see.

 \[00:20:37\] Yeah.

That might be because the success rates of startups is going up and therefore I mean when an investor is pricing an investment.

 \[00:20:50\] Unfortunately the entrepreneur is paying for the fact that a number of the investors investments are not going to work out right.

So I mean what we want.

We understand that a third of the things we invest in are not going to work at all a third of the things we invest in are going to kind of work but not not particularly well and and it\'s the final third that actually produce all the returns.

And so the entrepreneur who is taking money from us who\'s in that group that\'s producing all the returns is actually paying a little bit for the failure rates right because we\'re thinking about it you know what\'s the blended return on our portfolio.

Well if failure rates go down because of things like why see that increase the probability of success.

And I I absolutely believe that while he does that.

 \[00:21:36\] Then maybe that\'s part of why pricing has gone up given that the world is so connected now.

 \[00:21:44\] We have the internet.

Thank you internet and people out on the Internet or watching us now.

 \[00:21:50\] Investors are finding deals all over the place.

You\'re funny you mention Philadelphia Berlin all over the place.

Given that seem that there would be parity in prices where ever you are it shouldn\'t matter that your location is Silicon Valley or New York or Berlin it\'s not yet.

 \[00:22:05\] Not yet.

Angel List maybe has the potential to change that.

I mean if we really end up with a a.

Nasdaq like market for for seed and series A and Series B investments then then that would would happen.

But still a lot of investing particularly seed investing is local and people want to be able to meet the entrepreneur and hear the pitch in.

And possibly join a board or at least be on an advisory board or spend some time on a regular basis with the entrepreneur.

And so that means that entrepreneurs who are in places where there is a lot of capital like Silicon Valley and New York to a slightly lesser extent but there\'s a lot of capital here.

You are in a better situation than than entrepeneurs were parts of the world where there isn\'t much of that money.

So.

So I think also investors may have a higher comfort factor with startups that are in.

Regions that have a lot of startup density.

I\'m not entirely sure why that would be the case but I think that probably.

 \[00:23:12\] Is new.

I think there\'s something of an environmental aspect to that when you\'re around other people who are doing startups and are talking about technology I think it\'s beneficial.

I know that when I left finance to work in startups at which point by the way I applied for the USV Analyst Program and was summarily rejected without even an interview.

No interview.

Wow.

Yeah.

So thank you.

I guess it\'s worked out pretty well.

You know but but this is part of why why he thinks that.

We\'ll find great startups wherever they are.

We want that to come to Silicon Valley.

So we\'ll see how things are done there and then go back.

Right.

Right.

We went out to New York.

All right.

Whatever is best for your business right.

That\'s kind of where you should be.

 \[00:23:53\] I think that\'s right or whatever is best for you.

Right.

I know some entrepreneurs want to build their companies in a place where they want to raise their families or whatever.

You know that could be Silicon Valley that could be New York.

That could be Boston it could be Boulder a beatnik you know.

 \[00:24:09\] So I do agree that you should do a startup in the place that\'s best for you.

But I also think maybe you should do it in.

There\'s.

Probably at least.

A dozen geographies around the world that have enough startup density and investor density that.

Would be a decent place to build a company.

I would say you pick pick one of those.

You don\'t go to a.

You know.

Some.

Out of the way place that it will be hard to recruit management right even if there\'s cheap housing.

Yeah I mean you know it\'s really really hard to recruit people to know.

If you were doing a startup in Bozeman Montana you\'d think you\'d you.

I mean I don\'t mean to pick on Boesman.

It\'s a wonderful place.

 \[00:24:58\] But you know I just think you\'d have a hard time recruiting the really high quality talent there.

Either you\'re gonna find it locally or you\'re kind of stuck.

I was just in Israel a couple of weeks ago in Tel Aviv and.

 \[00:25:12\] Dega and I was I was struck by how vibrant the scene was there.

I knew that there was great technology that I knew there were great investors.

But it seems like some of what\'s going on in San Francisco and in New York is starting to seep out there.

 \[00:25:25\] Oh I think it\'s well I mean you know Israel has been a startup hub for a long time.

They had a little bit of a a period where they would be a little bit of what happened in Boston although I think that.

Israel has bounced back stronger in some ways than Boston.

But what happened was there was a transition from sort of more infrastructure and enterprise stuff to more consumer stuff.

Really around the time we started USV was when it kind of really started to happen and.

Entrepreneurs and Deasy\'s in both Israel and Boston I think struggled to make that transition as quickly as entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley and New York.

It was easy for you.

New York was easy to make that transition because it always had a bent that way to begin with.

But Silicon Valley I was always impressed by how quickly they made that transition.

And I think that Israel went through a little bit of a period where they struggled but they got they got their mojo back.

And because you know they\'ve been doing startups in Israel particularly in Tel Aviv for 20 or 30 years now.

At least.

They have a lot of repeat entrepreneurs and a lot of talent and a lot of knowledge about how to do these kinds of things.

So you take you take a team to Silicon Valley to kind of see how things are done there what the people in Israel know how to do a startup.

So they had the culture there.

And it\'s it\'s it\'s a great place.

 \[00:26:54\] And unfortunately don\'t have much more I\'m left.

I do want to turn back to New York one last time because it\'s where we are and it\'s where we want to be finding more companies.

Right.

You know I\'m curious over the next over the next few years.

Looking back the last few years what\'s happened.

What do you see coming in New York that particularly interests you.

 \[00:27:12\] Well the big observation is that enterprise SAS type business models seem to be thriving in New York right now.

We have a few in our portfolio but they\'re there they\'re everywhere I look I\'m seeing really good SAS enterprise companies getting built here and that was definitely not what the vibe was in New York in 2009 2010.

Now I think it\'s a balance.

We\'ve still got lots of good consumer stuff going on but now I think we\'ve got an equally strong B2B SAS type of.

Startup environment here and that\'s really good for New York because you know it.

You know you need to have both kinds of companies I think they\'re.

You know terrible for these CEOs to have both kinds of companies in their portfolio.

And I think that you know the talent pool here in New York can work in both.

 \[00:28:11\] So that probably the big biggest change and then also just so much more capital here.

Yeah which is great for New York.

Yes.

Well Fred thank you so much for joining us today at.
