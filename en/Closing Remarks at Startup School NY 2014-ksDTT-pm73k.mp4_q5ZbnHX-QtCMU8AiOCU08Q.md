**Closing Remarks at Startup School NY 2014-ksDTT-pm73k.mp4**  \[00:00:00\] Wow.

It is it is a good thing we close the show with Chase and Wannsee.

I am so proud that Y Combinator started accepting non-profit applications and we could not have had a better inaugural nonprofit than Wazza if any of you are starting a nonprofit to have friends who are here all are just as welcome to apply to ISY as you are would be with your for profit startups.

Well.

A zit.

It\'s all over.

Not totally over we\'ve got some mingling and some pizza afterwards but before we get there I have a couple announcements one Cameroon has lost 40 0.

It\'s not close unfortunately.

Croatia were the victors.

Now in other news this whole event this was a first time effort here in New York and I could not be happier.

 \[00:00:50\] But I want all of you to let us know everyone who is on stage.

Please tweet at them with questions you can tweet at Y Combinator we\'re reading those who tweet at me at Alexis Ohanian.

We want the feedback because we want to keep doing this.

We want to keep improving and an event like this doesn\'t happen without the work of a lot of amazing people.

So first I want to thank all the speakers who came up here.

I want to thank the startups because those startups.

Yes I will.

Clap.

Through this.

These startups who came up and presented they were just randomly chosen from the audience.

OK.

On top of all that pressure there just attendees just like all of you I\'m covering for them yes.

And.

And finally all the people here behind the scenes made this work.

All the people the best buy theater rock and the cameras the sound and then everyone at Y Combinator and in particular Tara Irina and Kat for putting on this amazing event.

 \[00:01:42\] So please thank you to all of you really made has made this wonderful.

 \[00:01:49\] And of course you all.

And I hope this is like I said we\'ll clap clap for you guys too.

Thank you.

Like I said Please keep the feedback coming please keep the conversations coming.

And remember this isn\'t the last time this isn\'t the last start of school.

In fact we\'re doing one in London next month if you guys Fancy a trip across the pond there\'ll be another one in the valley a few months from now and we\'re actually having the first ever Y Combinator hackathon which you can still apply to August 2nd and 3rd.

Please go online apply if you want to come out of the valley.

The pizza is not as good but the hackathon should be a lot of fun.

It\'s our first ever effort.

So finally guys again thank you so much for coming out.

Please keep the feedback coming.

Please keep the conversations coming.

And yes there is pizza and the best way to get it is through either one of these side exits.

You will not be left behind.

I guarantee it will be a slice of pizza waiting for you.

Thank you again thank you so much.
