**David Lee at Startup School NY 2014-Dt-8Io0i\_F4.mp4**  \[00:00:00\] Right now we have pretty special investor here right now David Lee has done a thing or two with investing over the years he\'s one of the founding members and one of the founding partners rather of the angel a little investment outfit you may have heard of invest that in a few things.

Airbnb indeed.

Dropbox Twitter Snapchatetc.

So let\'s hear a little bit of his insights gained over the years about all things startups.

Please Clap it up.

David.

 \[00:00:43\] So I have to admit some I\'ve I\'ve spoken a lot I\'m a little nervous right now.

My daughter is here.

I\'ve never spoken in front of her and my mother in law is here so if I stumble just you know bear with me.

 \[00:00:59\] But let me just say this there has never been a more exciting or better time to start a company from what\'s happening in mobile computing and different areas like drones virtual reality bitcoin bioinformatics.

There are so many different areas to explore as as a as a startup founder.

So I\'m really honored to be here and really excited for you as you think about starting a company.

 \[00:01:30\] So as Alexis mentioned I\'ve been angel investing since 2007 really with Ron.

 \[00:01:37\] I\'ve been doing that with Ron Conaway and ASV Angel.

So it\'s been about seven years but it feels like dog years through that time.

I\'ve worked with probably over 500 founders in the team and I at SFA annual have reviewed over 6000 business plans.

 \[00:01:55\] So as Alexis mentioned some of those companies and I don\'t know where the clicker is.

Some of those companies include Pinterest Dropbox square stripe geared hub.

Many of these companies and many of these founders have spoken here at Startup School.

So I really encourage you to go back go to YouTube listen to their stories because some of their stories are really telling because particularly when they start their company they\'re not the people that you see today.

 \[00:02:30\] So given all of this data that we have and obviously given the number of companies that we\'ve reviewed and the companies that we\'ve worked with not all if not most of the companies are not the Pinterest Dropbox Airblade and stripe.

 \[00:02:44\] I thought what I would do today is for you is really three things.

The first thing I would do is tell you a little bit about what we look for at Assefi Angel when evaluating a startup.

The second thing I want to do is I want to talk a little bit about what you should be looking for when picking investors.

There\'s never been a better time as a as a startup founder to seek financing reasons which I\'ll get into a little bit later and so it\'s important to be discerning and think about what you should be looking for in the final thing that I\'m going to share is the biggest lesson that I\'ve learned from Ron Conway in my seven years of working with him.

 \[00:03:26\] So as Alexis mentioned you know Ron is a prolific angel investor he\'s been investing since for about 20 years and really invented this class of angel and seed investing.

And this one thing he taught me.

I bring it up over and over again and I think it has particular relevance for you as a startup founder or if you decide to work for a company or you decide to be an investor.

And frankly it\'s the one lesson that I always think about when we decide whether or not to invest in a founder again.

So before I get more specific I want to tell you a story about the first founder or entrepreneur that I\'ve ever known and that\'s my dad.

So my dad graduated with hisPh.D.

in mechanical engineering from UCLA in 1962.

He was the first Asian to graduate in that graduate program and then in the mid 70s he worked at a company called Alpha Industries.

And so for those of you I mean this probably I\'m dating myself but in the mid 80s mid 70s Route 128 in Boston that was Silicon Valley Silicon Valley was the upstart that was Silicon Valley SoMa as hot as you can get.

And he was a senior engineer at one of these high flying companies.

So he did that for about five years and one day and this is about the early 80s he decided to quit.

And he realized that even though he was very happy doing what he was doing and he had two kids to provide for a family he wasn\'t following his passion and his passion really was building things for other people and for other companies.

And he thought if others could do it why couldn\'t he.

So he just quit.

Didn\'t know what the product was and decided to go out on his own a very risky venture.

 \[00:05:25\] So the first product that he built was of the first fully automated fortune cookie machine.

So before my dad\'s machine you made fortune cookies by hand.

And he built the machine that automated the whole process so he was sort of a robotic startup before it\'s time.

And I don\'t know if any of you remember there there used to be those fortunes with the smiley faces on them.

Those were my dad\'s.

That\'s how I went to college.

 \[00:05:55\] So laughter so please thank you.

 \[00:06:04\] But this was the first product that he was going to use to catapult his whole company because he wanted to build other things.

But it turns out there was actually a decent market for Fortune Cookie machines and fortune cookies.

People eat them.

And 30 years later at 79 years old he is still building these machines and he\'s doing it.

I mean it\'s a great story and it sounds good.

He\'s doing it in one part because he loves it.

He would rather do nothing else than build.

But there\'s another part where he does it because he has to.

He does it because he has to do it to keep the lights on because this 30 year journey which I witnessed and lived through.

 \[00:06:44\] It\'s something the ups and downs.

It\'s something that were borderline.

I mean it\'s gut wrenching.

It\'s really hard and I\'m sure a lot of founders have talked about this but there is the one thing that I\'ve learned in that sort of being his son is the price you have to pay in order to do what you love for a living.

And that\'s a pretty steep price.

And that\'s why we try to really stand behind all of the founders who do it because we know it\'s not easy.

So with that in mind I want to jump into what we look for at Assefi Angel.

So I\'m going to give access to all of you to this one document and many a here at Wykeham air have seen it and it\'s document that we have used since I started working at Assefi angel.

It\'s a document that Ron wrote 20 years ago and a document that we refined over time and it\'s the one document that that\'s really it\'s our Magna Carta.

 \[00:07:43\] It\'s our Bill of Rights and it\'s called appropriately what Ron NSV angel look for in a company.

And it is simply just a laundry list of items that we look for over the and over the years things that that just remind us.

It\'s almost like a checklist.

And so given that it\'s a laundry list.

And I will share this with you afterwards.

What I wanted to do is just point out one or two laundry list items and tell you you know what we look for and why these things are important to us.

So the first point that I want to highlight is that in the very first line in this document and this is the this is a sentence that Ron wrote 20 years ago so you have this title and then you have this line.

And so for those this is a little inside baseball you can see this is sort of a weird lots of weird typos all caps.

This  \[00:08:38\] is just how low a lot of grammatic grammatical nets in this document but this document talks about the team we had us angel we look at Founders first ideas second we believe that ideas morph.

But people don\'t.

If we like the founder and we believe in the founder more than likely we will invest.

If it\'s a sector that we like and for us there are some particulars we may like.

We\'ve always preferred founders who build things for themselves or founders whose company is an extension of their life story.

In that the founding of a company has been built.

It\'s been built up over years but not all startups are like that.

And one thing I do want to emphasize is that while we look for may be very different from what other investors look for and so hopefully though that this is just one proxy and some insight into how we make decisions so one of the qualities that I want to talk about and one of the items in our laundry list is this good elevator pitch.

Keep it simple.

Now again this probably you know if I was looking at this for the first time eyes would glaze over I\'d say of course you have to have a good elevator pitch.

You know this is it\'s written in every single MBA textbook but this is there\'s a nuance to this.

So in this environment where startups are more popular than ever and more smart people are going to startups than ever.

I believe that the single most important skill for a founder as the leader of his or her company is to be able to express their vision to other people and your ability to communicate that to prospective employees investors and customers is critical in this environment where there\'s so much noise and people have so many different options.

You know when you start your company and you\'re trying to hire somebody you will see how many options this candidate has.

And I want to be clear about something as well.

You know this is not about being a great public speaker.

This is not about you know being Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton and having this magnetic charisma.

You know some of the best startup pitchers in the best start of founders that I\'ve known are some of the most classically inarticulate people that you would meet.

And you know experts say that 80 percent of communication is nonverbal.

It\'s body language and your ability to express that vision is critical in this environment.

So I want to give one example or one story of this.

So I met Rick Morris and in at Y Combinator Demo Day I think it was in the winter of 2011.

Rick\'s company comprehend clinical what they do is they take disparate data sources in a Palantir like way and they bring them together and they make the data actionable and usable to shorten and make clinical trials more efficient for pharmaceutical companies and researchers at the time.

And that is this is not photo sharing it\'s not something that you look at you go wow this is awesome.

This is something that healthcareI.T.

was not something that made me lean forward and so at Demo Day Rick said hey can can we grab some coffee and to be courteous I said yep let\'s grab some coffee.

And I knew what the pitch was and he told me about it and he seemed like a very nice guy and his background was in this area.

So we ended up meeting about a week or two later and we met at this cafe on University Avenue in Palo Alto.

And for those of you who don\'t know university avenues like the Times Square of startups in Silicon Valley it\'s just you see everybody it\'s very loud it\'s very crowded.

And so we sat down in a coffee shop and again this was more of a courtesy see if I could help him as an entrepreneur after demo day and he was able to in that short period of time in that environment.

He talked to me about what he was trying to do and why this whole process was fundamentally broken and why this was such a big opportunity and why he was the person.

And he talked about how this could impact people\'s lives and the timing was right because what was happening with Obama care and what was happening with the digitization of genomic data and his background and Hall and his co-founder with expertise in machine learning.

And by the 40 45 minutes I was hooked.

And we invested right there and his ability to articulate that vision in this picture is a picture of him with his co-founder signing our term sheet.

I felt like if he could pitch if he could make me interested in this topic in healthcare II.T.

in 45 minutes what could he do with a prospective employees or a prospective investor or a prospective customer.

And I just said that is the type of person that I want to back.

And for me as somebody who\'s 44 years old that is something I think about I think about does this person have the potential to be somebody that I would want to work for and that I would want to get behind.

And so again he was not the most you know I hope he\'s not listening.

Most charismatic person but he was able to express his vision in a very authentic way and that in a very authentic infectious way.

So the second item that I want to highlight from this laundry list and that\'s Rick\'s company and again this is straight from the document.

Good listeners strong willed but flexible.

So the flip side of being a good communicator in my opinion is what I\'ve learned in my time investing is that the very best founders are great listeners.

And by that I mean they\'re not.

I don\'t mean listeners in the empathetic sense.

I mean listeners in the sense of taking multiple inputs processing and synthesizing all of them and being able to come to a decision or a point of view based on all of those inputs and sticking to that that vision.

You know Ron has always told me that Mark Zuckerberg This is his greatest strength his ability to listen and think about all the different opinions all the data points and come up with a vision based on that is the best that he\'s ever seen.

And so that ability to me again you will have many investors you\'ll have many advisers you\'ll have many mentors and they\'ll all be telling you different things or or they may be telling you the same thing.

And your ability to process that and synthesize that and make your decision based on that is something that it\'s really it\'s a skill that\'s invaluable because we have seen many many founders who are strong willed but inflexible.

These are bad listeners.

These are founders that we probably wouldn\'t back again.

These are founders who have a point of view and it\'s inspirational and it\'s strategic and it\'s smart but it\'s wrong and it\'s wrong in hindsight of course.

But at the time the way they do they just don\'t listen.

They ignored the inputs because they have one point of view.

So I\'m going to use Rick again as an example.

So we invested in Rick.

He did his seed.

He then six months later as often happens he hit a rough patch and he realized that not everybody bought into his vision from a fundraising standpoint and not all the customers were biting either.

And so like all startups there was just this point of doing okay but not doing great.

And the thing that Rick did over and I\'ve seen it.

The thing that he did over this 16 month period is that he really listened he got to multiple inputs.

He really understood and ask great questions.

Why.

Why aren\'t you buying this.

Why aren\'t you investing with one particular investor.

He invested it.

He pitched them three times and he did this with multiple investors.

And each time they said no.

He said Why what\'s the feedback.

Why.

Why wouldn\'t you invest.

What do I need to do better.

And some of the things that they told him he ignored.

But some of the things that they told him he said you know what they might be right.

And when when those opinions resonated with the opinions of his customers he took his product and he moved it from a hosted solution to a SaaS solution.

And by this third pitch with this one investor the partner said to him You\'re the most persistent SLB I\'ve ever met.

And but he couldn\'t ignore the progress made the fourth time he pitched this firm Sequoia Capital.

The chairman of the firm Doug Leonys stood up and clapped and they eventually invested in his company.

And that is I think this is the best example one of the best examples that I\'ve seen of a founder getting to the root cause.

I can\'t tell you the number of times I\'ve seen I\'ve seen companies pitch either investor or a customer and they say no and then they give him the same pitch with maybe some progressive data and they\'re not getting to the root cause as to why somebody is saying no it\'s OK to go back.

It\'s ok to be persistent.

So long as you\'re going with a different with a different angle and a different vector a more informed angle or more form vector so those are just a couple of things.

And again what we look for in a company is really just a laundry list of what we look for in people.

I can\'t tell you the number of times I\'ve been working with Ron and we talk about a founder and he\'ll say to me here she is a good founder or she is she is a bad founder and they\'re not he\'s not talking about Mark Zuckerberg or Ben Silbermann or the people who have flamed out.

These are just the people who are who are going through their startup right now and it\'s because they do some of these things.

They do some of the things that are simple but not easy.

So that\'s those are just a couple of items and again I\'ll share this list with you.

Now I want to take sort of a flip side and talk about what you should look for when looking when speaking to investors and looking for money.

So you\'re going to hear a lot of different viewpoints and a lot of different advice in my opinion it\'s just one thing and one thing only value add.

The only thing you should think about is that every investor needs to add value.

And this statement is kind of like a Rorschach test.

It\'s like value add is different things to different people and different founders.

It means something completely different for a first time founder doing an enterprise company to a second time founder doing something and consumer.

It depends on the founder the market and the industry.

And you as the founder you should really think about be self-critical of your sort of you and your company to think about what are some of the known unknowns as Don Rumsfeld said.

Like what are some of the challenges that I can anticipate even though most of the challenges are going to be unknown.

You at least want to think about hey who do I think can help me.

And what do I need to do to get him in her him or her on my side.

And so a lot of founders focus on valuation dilution and we\'ve always said if you just focus on this and you focus on value addvs.

ownership in the company then the valuation discussion just flows from that.

So I\'ll give you one example so we invested in a guy named Jason Tan and his company is SIFF science.

So Jason he was doing a company and is doing a company that currently is in preventing fraud for e-commerce.

As you as some of you know e-commerce is changing the way people buy the way people sell and so the fraud problems are different.

And we invested in him.

We\'re very excited about the company and an opportunity came up for him.

Now this is now an opportunity came up for somebody an individual named Max Levchin.

You may know who he is.

He was one of the founders of PayPal probably one of the best people in the world when it comes to this area and he\'s spoken here at Startup School.

And Max said to him Hey I want to get involved in this company and I want to help you.

But here\'s the thing I want you to to stay with me.

I want you to sit in our office.

I want to mentor you one day a week.

I want to really dig deep and help you here.

And I spoke to Jason about it and that the terms were different probably more favorable to max than other investors.

But I said you have to do this.

I mean this is you can\'t were you know and not that he was.

But don\'t worry about the dilution or what your cap table looks like worry about getting the best people who will add the most amount of value to your side if Max wanted to invest and said Hey I\'ll give you 100k and maybe I\'ll have breakfast with you once or twice a month.

That\'s a different proposition than what Max was offering.

And so Jason without much thought decided to work with Max and today he is a company that his is a company that\'s doing well.

And Max was instrumental in that and now that\'s an extreme case.

And hey for some of you and for many of you it\'ll be the case that the biggest value add for the investor is that the money is green and that they want to invest.

But for those of you who have choices.

And the reason why I say that this is the best time to raise money is that you will have more you have more choices than ever you know with what\'s happening here at Y Combinator Angel List the Jobs Act crowdfunding Kickstarter.

These companies are changing the way that it is expanding the number of sources for financing both debt and equity that you can raise.

There are many many companies now many may be overstating it but it\'s not uncommon right now and I wouldn\'t be surprised if in the next year there are many companies who get financed on Kickstarter.

Some of the other crowdfunding platforms and then go straight to the larger cities.

So with all of these different choices you really want to be discerning in thinking about what value is an investor going to add.

So the final thing that I want to talk about and I\'m bumping up against my time this is the one lesson that I\'ve learned from Ron.

It\'s the biggest lesson that I always think about and this is simply this.

Never forget your reputation is your biggest asset.

 \[00:24:39\] Now you as the founder and this is also some laundry list items from from this part you as the founder.

What I can say is building your reputation is the best investment you can make in your career in technology.

And it\'s the best way that you can sort of build your your your career.

 \[00:25:02\] What do I mean by that.

What do I mean that is leading by example.

You want to be completely focused on your on your startup.

Everybody is going to be looking at you and you want to control what you can control.

I don\'t know how many startups or how many founders who ignored this and who ignored the little things.

So for example when Ron did Ron we invested in 1998 he would talk about how they would have seminars for best practices Sergei Brin and Larry Page where the only ones who showed up to every single one.

Now I\'m not saying that\'s because that\'s why they\'re Google but it\'s just an example of controlling what you can control.

 \[00:25:44\] Another example Joseph Wollar.

Hello sign.

We had Sefi angel.

We have cocktail parties for our CEO summits where we bring our investors partners and CEOs.

 \[00:25:56\] He came and he tapped me on the shoulder and he had a yellow posted of all the people he wanted to meet who could be helpful for his company.

He was the only founder who did that and this was a cocktail party.

Most of it thought it was a boondoggle.

He thought it was work.

 \[00:26:11\] I will never forget that.

So in summary.

 \[00:26:21\] I\'ve given you a lot of sort of platitudes a lot of things that could be written on tweets or fortune cookies.

Be a good leader lead by example.

Look for value add stores.

Be a good listener.

But I can\'t emphasize enough that that\'s just a starting point for this journey that you\'re going on.

We really know that this is simple but not easy it\'s a lot of hard work to really follow and do what you love.

And we had SVR Angel can\'t be more excited about the environment and can\'t be more excited about meeting you and possibly investing in you.

Good luck.
