**Shana Fisher at Startup School NY 2014-Vp48ko2VJgE.mp4**  \[00:00:01\] So I\'m Kavan Yallock and I am a partner at Y Combinator and I\'m excited to see you all here today and I\'m also excited to introduce you to Shanna Fisher.

Shana is the founder and managing partner of Highline Venture Partners which is based here in New York City and she\'s also a board partner at injuries and Horowitz as an early stage investor.

Shana invested in companies like Maker Bot Pinterest 53 Refinery 29 and even Y CEO Lumb stripe.

So investors know her as someone who has this incredible ability to recognize greatness in early stage entrepreneurs even before they have traction.

But maybe more importantly her portfolio companies know her.

As someone who helps them realize that greatness.

So we\'re really lucky to have her here today and I am excited to welcome Fisher.

 \[00:01:01\] Thank you so much.

It\'s so great to be here.

 \[00:01:08\] Thank you so much to Y Combinator.

I really am a big admirer of the program.

Fund a lot of companies out of ricey and it\'s it\'s really the main reason I\'m here.

One thing that\'s important for me to say before I start is I really never blog or tweet or say anything about what I do.

So why am I here.

I\'m here really because I love Y Combinator 1 and 2 I love New York for startups.

So you know when not when I was invited I thought okay this will be this will be fun.

There\'s a variety of reasons why I don\'t really talk about what I do.

But the main reason is I think really the companies are the most important thing about what I do.

So it\'s really not important for me to talk it\'s really more important for them to talk.

So when I was invited here I really to think like I do I really want to do this.

And you know one of the main.

And what do I want to say.

 \[00:01:58\] And the main reason I decided to come is because the reason I don\'t blog or tweet or talk about what I do is that I often am told I give the opposite advice of what people normally hear.

So I thought that\'s a great way to use this time.

I\'m going to just go through the major areas that I hear over and over and over again that I\'m giving people the opposite advice of what they normally hear.

And I thought that would be the best way to use this time.

So first of all I made this presentation with a lot of help but one of one of the things is it\'s in this beautiful format of paper which I think is an amazing presentation format.

So if you\'re wondering what this is it\'s it\'s one of my companies that I love very much.

53 is paper.

So.

The first thing I\'ll cover is runway.

I\'m just going to like hit a couple of major topics and talk about my thoughts on each one.

So one of the first things I see when companies come to raise money is that they\'re raising money for runway so they\'ll often say I\'m raising a million and half dollars that\'s for 18 months.

And and that\'s and that\'s what we\'re doing right there.

I don\'t like that.

So I like when when people are raising money to get their company done by any means necessary.

It\'s not about having 18 months.

It\'s about making whatever you raised last and whatever you\'re able to raise last whether you\'re raising a lot or whether you\'re raising a little.

And actually one of the things that I think is really great about Y Combinator and I\'ve I\'ve known Weiss\'s since it was a Boston program and if you meet companies from Weiss\'s and you talk to them even the ones that are in the Boston program 16 seven years ago what you realize is that they don\'t think about raising money as runway in the very early stage.

They think about it as How am I going to get this done by any means necessary and how long is it going to last.

And and and that\'s the most important thing.

It\'s not about.

It\'s not about having enough because runway really is about labor.

It\'s about payroll it\'s about rent.

So what you often find in companies that aren\'t thinking about runway they think about how we\'re going to solve some of those problems in different ways.

How am I going to get not to pay rent.

So one of the things I try to do for my companies especially if they don\'t raise a lot of money is how to get them free space for as long as possible.

That\'s one of the that\'s just one of the one of the ways to get the money ticking down another way is of course thinking about labor how many people do you really need.

Who are you paying.

Why are you paying them how much you paying them.

And that\'s a big factor.

So I think runway is sort of one of those things.

It\'s often the thing in the beginning that is is like the most important of how to get as far as you can because you know your valuation only goes up after that.

And hopefully that\'s that\'s sort of my philosophy on runway founders cofounders.

Common knowledge I think is that it\'s it\'s good to have cofounders.

For some people I think that\'s true.

I have a lot of single founders in my portfolio I think I think I think it\'s not always right to have cofounders.

I think certain people certain people that can take a company really far actually are not are not actually equipped to have cofounders.

They\'re actually better being a single founder.

And so I don\'t make exceptions to two that I like.

I like to see.

I like to see people that can take the company the distance and having a single founder might sometimes be the best way to do that.

If you do have cofounders I think it\'s really important not to have repeat skills develop or designer obviously incredibly important product.

Sometimes that\'s inside a developer sometimes that\'s outside sometimes that\'s inside a design or sometimes that\'s outside.

I think it\'s really important when you\'re looking at who you\'re starting a company with.

I can\'t I\'m not going to make a generalization.

Sometimes people have known each other forever.

They may have overlapping skills they may have known each other growing up and they may be the right person to start a company with.

But a lot of times what I\'m seeing are people that like just met the person couple weeks ago or months ago because they wanted to start a company.

Now it\'s starting a company.

So is just something people do when they graduate.

There\'s so many companies.

People feel like that\'s the only way to do it.

And I think that some people are just better to be single founders and you should structure the company around around your own skills.

 \[00:06:47\] Time that\'s time to launch.

That\'s what this means to me.

 \[00:06:55\] Common knowledge I think is you should get product out quick.

You should iterate and it should be Leive.

Actually I often take the take the opposite view on this.

I think they\'re four years ago I might have said launch quick.

That\'s actually important today because there\'s thousands of startups and it\'s the thing that many many many people are doing.

I actually think you should take as much time as possible to make your product perfect.

And because there is so much competition you have to really think differently about what space you\'re in and how much time you\'re taking the launch it\'s actually possible today to have smaller groups of users doesn\'t have to be alive.

But I actually don\'t think it\'s good to rush products out.

I think if it takes you a year to make your product perfect then you should take a year.

It\'s not about getting it out because I think you have to have the hooks in it and a couple of of of like Trappes that are going to be the reason why consumers love your product and it can take a while to craft that.

And it\'s not so important.

I think today to just get something out there a minimum viable product I think actually what it\'s important to do today is to try to figure out how you\'re going to raise above and level above all all of the competitors.

And and that\'s something that timeline\'s kind of goes back to runway are really important to think about.

 \[00:08:23\] Initially location.

 \[00:08:28\] New York versus San Franciscovs.

everywhere else.

I really like.

I love New York.

I love New York to create companies I think New York is a very creative city.

I think it gives gives people a lot of inspiration.

There certainly a lot of a lot of input.

You get your product that you don\'t get in a community where everybody is doing tech.

There\'s a lot of money in the early stage in New York.

So I think that\'s excellent.

What there isn\'t is a lot of money in the middle stage.

It\'s still California I think primarily that has a huge advantage with the trajectory companies are able to get and doing things like Y Combinator.

Actually if you\'re going to be located in New York is extremely strategic.

You might not even think about the relationships that you\'re forming there how valuable they are going to be two years from now you\'re just thinking about how do I get my thing funded how do I get my startup like to be separated from everybody else which I see is excellent.

But what it\'s also good at is really putting down roots in California.

So if you\'re gonna be in New York you have to have some roots there if you\'re ever going to if you\'re gonna want to go back there and having investors in both cities I think is also really important because you get very different perspectives and that\'s why I think location has to be thought about very strategically.

Certain companies I think have real advantages to being a city in an urban environment like New York or other cities.

Others have real advantages with the amount of people you can hire and the talent that you find in California.

So Northern California.

So I think that\'s my view on location and I sometimes hear I sometimes hear the opposite or not an honest evaluation of what are really the pros and cons so this is like my favorite one.

Nobody knows anything.

Especially when it comes to investors.

And I think about that all the time myself and I find I find actually it\'s very liberating.

It\'s very liberating because I know many of the great companies that I found when I found them absolutely nobody else was looking at them most people didn\'t like them.

And it was very difficult to tell them what they were going to become was going to be as big as they had.

They did become.

And I think it\'s important for all of you starting companies to really remember when you\'re talking to investors it\'s very personal.

It\'s very subjective.

So if you hear negative comments if you hear like this doesn\'t make any sense.

Nine times out of ten that might be true but one time it may be that you\'re what you\'re doing is so new that nobody can evaluate it.

And that\'s when really great things happen.

You also might be talking to an investor that have just just 10 investments and they\'re not even they\'re not even in the headspace to do yours.

So I think it\'s really important to you know when you sit down with investors talk about what are the last couple deals you did.

Look if you get someone that hasn\'t done a deal in a while they\'re actually maybe more open minded to you.

And I think you have to be more strategic about it you can\'t you can be more strategic about the people you\'re talking to not just closing your round you can close people that are really going to spend the time and actually have an open mind to what you\'re doing and give you good feedback.

So it\'s really important when you\'re talking to investors to realize look they probably are not any better position to evaluate what you\'re doing in a weird way then then you know the next person sitting next to you.

There\'s a lot of patterns.

People get stuck in patterns I don\'t actually believe in patterns.

I think patterns actually can trap you so into wanting to see the same thing that worked before.

But you know the river the river is always flowing and the markets are very different.

What work today is not going to be work.

You know it\'s not going be saying it worked for years ago.

So personally I try not to look for patterns and contradict myself a lot so I\'m talking about patterns but I\'m talking about my advice.

But I think when you when you\'re starting out in really crafting your company just thinking about the role that investors play and who you\'re talking to and where are they coming from.

Do some research when you sit down with them before you just launch into your presentation and you\'ll get a sense hey is this person even like a candidate or are they probably you know kind of like is there is their plate already full.

A lot of investors can\'t even really know if they\'re a lead or a board member.

You know if they\'re on more than 12 boards that\'s like a lot.

So if you\'re talking to someone on 12 boards or someone who\'s new you\'re you\'re much more likely to get the results you want with someone who is very open minded to what to what you\'re building.

 \[00:13:01\] And these are some of the things to look for development.

 \[00:13:07\] I have a couple things on product development that I that I that I find myself going over a lot.

One actually I got this advice from from paper I was with the paper team this morning and I asked them like what you know how do you guys think about product development as a startup what are some of the things you did that you think are valuable and what are the things that you think that you think you wish you knew.

And one of one of the things that\'s really important and I really believe this goes back to the number of people on the team I think it\'s really important to build for today.

If you read development blogs and many people that have worked at bigger companies leave those companies with the same disciplines.

And a lot of those disciplines you might read about in development blogs like aren\'t you know you\'re gonna spend a lot of time on infrastructure but you\'re not going to spend a lot of time on the products you\'re trying to build for today and prioritizing what actually is building for today.

Having a big vision because when you start a company you often have a big vision like this is what were going to do.

This is our business.

This is an area we\'re trying to disrupt.

But from a real product development standpoint what\'s today\'s problem you\'re actually going to solve.

And I often advise companies that are also going to Y see go to see to grow because some of the connections and the relationships you\'re making have really been incredible difference makers for companies to either get other startups using their product or take advantage of the mentors there to teach them like really how to craft growth.

When you have that solid product and I think that\'s one of the best things to remember about about building another thing I like to think about again time I think I think you want to take as much time as possible to build a perfect product.

One thing that\'s related to this is design.

I think today design is really becoming like all the same great design is all the same there\'s the same CSSA templates.

A lot of people are using.

And so the line kind of bleed into each other you know kind of what makes great design today it\'s like flat it\'s whatever you know whatever sort of Apple is also bringing forward which is great but you don\'t have any breakthroughs.

So if everybody\'s using the same templates the same full bleed photos the same sans serif fonts the same saturated colors which are all beautiful and today we\'re train especially investors are trained to look at a design and be like oh that\'s clean that\'s beautiful that looks like it\'s supposed to look but it looks like everything else.

So what I actually like to look for and I\'ve funded a lot of stuff that did not look good because I knew like all you have to do is a good tip of the iceberg you should have to put some design onto that.

But if you have something really breakthrough don\'t worry about how it looks because how it looks is often going to be something you can do use one of those as templates that everybody else is going to judge you by.

But I think if there\'s any designers in the room I think it\'s time to push past what everybody is starting to look like and that\'s something that I look for.

I know that you know we got to this design because there you know this kind of pervasive design because you know there was another pervasive design that kind of got overtaken by this one I think we\'re ready to have a new a new look.

I don\'t know what it is of course that\'s what I look for everyday but I\'d really like to see products not be so skin deep because I think that you can get trapped in the skin deep ness of a product and not worry about what what are you really trying to do that\'s breakthrough underneath.

How hard is it.

How much time does it take to get perfect and often design is last.

 \[00:16:48\] And I hope there are breakthroughs there but I really would focus on sort of the iceberg of the productvs.

versus the surface people so related to runway know people raise money and they say we\'re going to go higher five people to hire seven people hire for developers because we need for developers to get this done by three months.

And what I found is that most people that are starting startups don\'t know how to manage people and you know you\'re going to find yourself overwhelmed.

And it\'s really important to affect how you manage people one by one.

So if you say have a single founder you should hire one person and perfected with that person.

If you have two founders hire one person Perfecta how you\'re going to manage that person and build the team that way.

I think another thing is this it sounds this is going to sound really cheesy I guess but diversity is really important.

And you know if you look around and your founders and your company all look the same you\'re just not going to have enough views of of of of your user and a lot of found you know some controversial but most founders your mail.

I\'ve certainly funded a lot of female founders.

I\'ve funded a lot of products that are for women created by males.

But they say they prioritize higher hiring women pretty early on.

So it\'s sort of a you know equal opportunity thing I mean you want to find the best person for the job but you you you really should think about bringing other people into the company not just being female founders but bring bring women into the company either in design roles development roles.

You know there\'s a lot of times in my companies they probably get tired of me doing this but I meet a young female developer who I think has promise and I\'ll like just tell a company you have to hire.

You have to train her because there\'s no way people are going to get opportunities unless founders prior founders who really are in the position of taking their companies forward do that and you\'re going to find those people are so valuable you\'re not even going to impartially it\'s karma.

But I actually believe it\'s one of those things that if you bring these these these people into the into your company whether it\'s you know racial diversity or gender diversity or or just people people that don\'t think like you know mental diversity however you want to say it.

I just think it\'s so critical to building great companies and I think when I look back at my companies that have succeeded this is what they\'ve done.

They haven\'t.

They didn\'t necessarily set out to do it but but they did it.

And I think it\'s actually indisputably a great thing to do.

We\'re not going to have more female founders unless they get more experience.

They\'re going to get more experience less they get great experiences and other startups.

So sometimes I think it\'s really important to prioritize these things.

That\'s just my view.

 \[00:19:54\] Can I talk to you for a minute.

This is a big one back to people.

 \[00:19:59\] You think you\'re building a startup to create a product.

You think you launch a product and you\'re building technology you\'re actually building people you\'re building a team and if you don\'t take care of managing that team it\'s gonna come over like a tidal wave you\'re going to have people coming up to you.

 \[00:20:14\] Can I talk to you for a minute.

That\'s kind of like what the symbol is.

People want to take you aside.

People want to know where my what\'s my standing in the company what\'s my position in the company where What\'s my role.

Why is this person getting that role.

Here\'s an idea I have.

That\'ll happen if you don\'t work on managing the people.

There\'s a really great paper called the scarf method one of the things I do is I love SEO coaches who really help founders grow as managers.

The scarf method is something that he recommends.

I\'ve read it\'s a sort of a neurological approach to how to manage people what people need to be managed if you just type s c A are f period period.

You\'ll find the paper if you don\'t you can e-mail me or else I\'ll send it to you.

It\'s just about what people need and you\'ll find if you take time to think about how you\'re managing the people on your team and you are actually now managing a group of humans would say you raise more money you take your company a little further.

You\'re going to hire are you going to hire people.

I do advise not to hire people very quickly especially if you\'ve never managed anyone.

I think you got to protect it and you\'ll make mistakes and those mistakes will become part of you as another manage as a good manager and you\'ll be able to hire someone else and retain someone else.

So you\'ll make mistakes.

I think you should make mistakes early so that you go and then you can and then you can correct that.

And it\'s not Adur it\'s not at a mission critical time.

So that\'s that\'s a big one if you see yourself surrounded with.

Can I talk to you for a minute out of your work.

Then you realize OK I need to step back and I need to figure out.

Am I managing the people around me.

What\'s happening.

Because you know the startup can be such an intense I\'m very empathetic.

It\'s a very intense environment.

You feel like you know you what you\'re doing is extremely important.

You lose perspective almost for everything else around you.

And that\'s actually really important.

It\'s really important to be in that no perspective place because that\'s how you can I think execute and do superhuman great superhuman and great things.

But it\'s really important to step back in and realize like I\'m managing people not just the product and many of my founders many founders I mean are engineers and that\'s just not something that they\'ve done.

But if you can do that you\'ll be great.

And no one will ever be able to kick you out of the CEO spot.

 \[00:22:38\] The equinox.

So the Equinox is something I like to think of is like that time horizon the line between when you don\'t have to make money when you do so personally I like companies that make money.

I like companies that have business models that companies like think about the business model ahead of time.

Even if I think there\'s no greater value in what you do than if somebody is willing to pay.

So I like companies with big smiles.

However I have definitely funded things without business models and they\'ve even had a really good idea a clearer idea of what they\'re gonna do even if they don\'t do in the first year they may not do it till the third year but they have a very clear idea of what they\'re going to do and I know there\'s a lot of examples out there that companies don\'t have that.

But I think you\'ll find you really control your destiny when you do control the money.

Either you control raising the money some people are very good at raising money or you\'re in control making money.

So the Equinox is like that time between it\'s like acceptable not to make any money and when it is.

And I think that\'s really important to recognize many founders don\'t recognize it and with enough time when that Equinox has passed.

So there is a certain amount of time where it\'s all potential and investors invest in potential you know very rare.

I mean they look they like to look for what they like to look for.

But a lot of that is what\'s potentially what\'s potentially going to be valuable and they project onto a company.

 \[00:24:01\] Now there\'s a certain time when you can do that in a time when you need to stop.

And as a founder you need to say like this is the time we need to cross over because we want to control our destiny.

And I think that\'s how I think of of the Equinox.

I think it\'s a very important concept that I try to help my companies with.

 \[00:24:17\] So I\'m wrapping up Cosmo\'s.

This is really meant to be about inspiration.

So I don\'t know if anybody\'s watching Cosmos on TV so good.

You know it\'s so good and I went back and watched the old cosmos.

 \[00:24:32\] I remember growing up how much I loved the old the original Cosmos and that really had a profound impact on me.

And if you\'re watching Cosmos and I really recommend everybody do it\'s on it\'s it\'s on FOX.

It\'s just that of the planet\'s Hayden Planetarium is the narrator and I recommend going into the dark matter show actually at 8 and Planetarium it\'s really extraordinary.

 \[00:24:55\] And what I think of when I when I\'m inspired by Cosmos is just the big problems there our resolve and and how you know on Earth where we don\'t really even understand the edge of the observable universe yet and how how deeply interesting that is to me and the problems of carbon and all the kind of things that are outlined in it through the through the through the narrative of that show.

And I don\'t know what that inspires me that inspires me so if I see like lots of little apps I\'m sort of like what is this.

This is lots of the same stuff.

I really love to see breakthrough things.

I think people really truly are you really only are going to achieve as big as you do dream and that\'s very corny but I think a lot of what I do is look for people that have really big dreams and they know how to build for today to get there and they know how to look at and say look I don\'t want to just do another app I actually want to do something that is meaningful and whether it\'s it maybe thinking about designing a breakthrough where whatever you view is meaningful whatever you view is inspirational.

It\'s really important I think when you\'re starting your company to have that spark.

Because if you don\'t have that it\'s going to show the authenticity shows it takes Pixar five years to make a movie.

Why are they the best movies because they took five years and they\'re made with a lot of heart.

A lot of people and a lot of ideas and there are so many companies right now to level up.

You have to do that.

It\'s going to be very hard to level up if if more people aren\'t doing that.

So whether you\'re watching Cosmos you\'re finding some other way to inspire you.

You know I really encourage everybody to dream big because you could get jobs and jobs would be a lot easier.

Lot easier startups are really hard.

So if you\'re gonna do it you gotta go for it.

And that\'s what I want to see.

So that\'s all.

Email me if you have any questions on what I said.

I hope you don\'t quote me though because that would you know I don\'t want to I don\'t want to debate it.

No I just want to put my shit out there and see what happens.

But you know if anything I said interest you.

I\'d love to talk to anybody.

Thank you I see.

Thank you 53 for helping me and this wonderful illustrator named Julia Lou who just put together these incredible visuals.

Thanks again.
