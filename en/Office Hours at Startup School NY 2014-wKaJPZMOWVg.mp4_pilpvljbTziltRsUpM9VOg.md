**Office Hours at Startup School NY 2014-wKaJPZMOWVg.mp4**  \[00:00:05\] So Gary tan and I are going to do on stage office hours.

This is most of what happens during my see the partners meet individually with startups and we give them advice about whatever problems they\'re facing.

It\'s usually Twenty five minutes per startup.

But we\'re going to try to do three startups in 25 minutes.

We\'ll see how that goes.

And.

 \[00:00:25\] Yeah look for them.

So can you send out the first.

Alright  \[00:00:33\] first started and we know there either.

I see you.

Sam.

I\'m.

 \[00:00:38\] I\'m going.

Nice to meet you.

Very nice to see you.

Great.

So I guess to start you just tell us what you do.

 \[00:00:47\] We are Salovey.

We had our users learned their value in the job market.

And we do that by crowdsourcing they\'re selling a prediction.

 \[00:00:57\] Do users mostly look at this when they\'re changing jobs they don\'t necessarily have to be changing or looking for jobs.

But.

Dale.

 \[00:01:06\] According to these 40 percent of American professionals have docked in line that they might be underpaid.

You have those kind of users too.

 \[00:01:17\] So are users using this just to find out if they\'re underpaid or because they\'re using it in salary negotiations.

Is it just for curiosity or are they really like saying I\'m underpaid.

 \[00:01:27\] So far we have been out partying each month.

They are using it for two years.

Now how many users do you have.

We currently have 9000 users and growing so fast.

Our weekly growth rate is 10 percent.

 \[00:01:42\] So like these services tend to be most valuable when you actually give people something not just for their curiosity but this like this critical thing they need to have for something they really care about.

So how can you make this something that people are now using just for curiosity.

But but they\'re using because they really desperately need this information they\'re acting on it.

 \[00:02:02\] So you need to create an efficient market for phones to Jack Murtha tonight.

So basically make the jump.

It could be more like the stock market.

So this is the first step for gold to price he\'s accurately and then get one step closer to that stock market for apps.

 \[00:02:21\] So you have 9000 users already.

Yes.

 \[00:02:24\] What\'s the most surprising thing surely you found people who are radically underpaid can get them better jobs like creating to other parts of the platform that employers come and they are going to able to he.

Professional profiles long been predicted and they will be able to make any offers based on that information.

And before that you\'ve been below that we have users who have at least I am told that they\'re you your prediction had Dyche boost their courage to ask for more money.

 \[00:02:59\] It\'s really hard to try to do multiple things at once as a startup and if you\'re trying to sort of make this great for for workers and for employees at the same time that\'s that\'s usually more than one startup can handle.

I would just focus entirely on making something that that please really love and that really helps them sort of get their market value.

And and you should track like how many employees come to your site find that they\'re underpaid and are able to use that to make sure they\'re getting a fair offer and market comp and that\'s like you really can only you have to just focus on one one one tiny little thing and then you can expand from there.

But until you know until you have users that are telling you like this is the best thing ever.

You know I got a 20 percent raise and I told all my friends sign up for the service.

You definitely shouldn\'t expand to other areas.

And I would try to really find out I\'d like to try and really find a metric that lets you focus on how many people are not just using you for idle curiosity where they use one time forget about it five minutes later not tell their friends not come back.

But how many people you can actually sort of like make this big difference.

And if you can do that then you\'ll have all these other high class problems later.

Like how you get employers into the market and how you make this efficient market.

 \[00:04:18\] But  \[00:04:19\] one of the things that we always tell startups during white see is that it\'s way more important to build something a small number of users really love than something that a lot of users find a little bit interesting or you\'d like to do is make something that a lot of people really love.

But a startup can never do that.

Like Google gets to do that.

And so you end up having to choose one of those two and a narrow focus on something that users become really dependent on you want to get to the place where where your users are telling you like I would be so bummed if this product went away.

I\'m so dependent on this I\'m going to use this for every future negotiating negotiation.

Do you have like a retention metric.

Do you know how much users come back.

 \[00:04:57\] We have 30 percent return rate.

How much.

70 percent 30 yeah over what time period will be just like two months ago.

So for every everyone who\'s tried the service there this thing can come back at least once.

And what are they.

What are they doing that second time.

You know they\'ve already checked.

So there are two sets of people.

 \[00:05:18\] They are checking their results.

They do want to see if they have new name predictions.

And the second group is just coming back to make more predictions because we have scores.

If you have there are politicians who get more cars and we have users that have made hundreds of predictions.

 \[00:05:37\] How do you know that it\'s working like hiding other predictions are accurate.

 \[00:05:40\] We ask users if they find their prediction fair and 40 percent say it\'s fair.

About 30 percent says.

It\'s low and 30 percent say it\'s high.

 \[00:05:56\] Or maybe 35 lo 35 25.

You.

What.

 \[00:06:07\] How will you know when you have found like something that users have become really dependent on what are you looking for in terms of behavior you\'d like to Zain when we first started everybody in our platform are able to predict each of their salaries anywhere in the.

 \[00:06:21\] And then we got enough users are able to divide into countries and you know the users so that we were able to divide into cities.

And then in the streets right now for instance my predictors will be technology folks in New York City.

You want to go from here even farther down that you want to be able to divide people into companies divide people into a usual experience for instance say that you have got a job offer from Microsoft and you want to build it and offer it then you will be able to crowdsource your prediction from folks who have worked at Microsoft as the same title as you.

 \[00:06:57\] That\'s right why you want to go slow and there is no way to validate if you are on their page right.

You need to find a job that pays you that a month.

Yeah.

Well there is no other way.

Even if these statistics if you look at labor labor data you can say that you are not underpaid because you are paid paid the same because the market has moved and the landscape changed on the way to day these predictions that we give back is to find them a job at that price point.

 \[00:07:27\] How are you getting users now.

 \[00:07:28\] How many users are going to use it for that and shredded Product Hunt and we are pitching to be partners using helping partners and blogs picked it up so that the finger remembers that that is great.

 \[00:07:44\] Those are great ways to get initial users but that that does not scale forever and it is worth thinking you know there are a lot of different sites where people can come to get salary information and you guys need to be like 10 times better than any of these other sites and it\'s worth thinking about what you\'re going to do to make yourself so much better that people will tell their friends your salary fairy not any of his other salary sites and b if there\'s some way you can build growth into the product.

Because this is not there\'s not any like inherent Viral Peace in this but you could probably build something really cool where you know you send out like an e-mail saying guess my salary to a bunch of your friends and then they sign up and building those.

Like a lot of people think about I\'m gonna build this product and I\'m making my users on Hacker News and then it\'s just going to grow.

And that\'s not.

Usually what happens if you build a sufficiently great product.

Sometimes that happens but you don\'t want to have growth be an afterthought and if you can build growth into the product in this early stage that can be really helpful.

 \[00:08:45\] And I would definitely think really of how to do that.

What else or better on this one.

 \[00:08:52\] Okay well I\'m a believer in crowd market coproduction so something.

Thank you.

Thank you.

 \[00:09:12\] All right.

Hey Sam that\'s me Jason.

Thank you.

Great to see you guys sort of the two of you working out.

 \[00:09:24\] So we\'re working on Parap Pappas safely the hotel tonight for Putin mentoring what is this rudimentary ecstasy in the trains.

Often you know some stores are pulled from shelves to three days in advance to sell buy stuff that stores can\'t sell here at the end of the day or that they\'re throwing away turning over every four to six hours.

They have a like French daily policy or like a fresh every quarter.

It\'s our policy.

It\'s food that doesn\'t necessarily have a place to go.

So if you\'re thinking about Oh well you know what I thought growing up you know things if you can\'t you take care of this access and I\'ll go somewhere.

We found in our research that that\'s actually not the case.

We talked to Feeding America.

We talked to City Harvest because of their own budgetary limitations they\'re not as nimble in terms of pickup and so see hires for example has a 50 pound minimum when it comes to pick up and a lot of small to medium sized businesses in New York City just aren\'t going to have that on a daily basis.

And so what they\'ve got now is basically like you can throw it away and even like pay action Holling to pick it up or is that most what happens it just gets thrown away.

 \[00:10:28\] Yeah yeah.

And so we found that to be highly efficient very wasteful and so what we\'re actually building is a marketplace that allows vendors to sell through that access commentary at a discount to users who are willing to buy that excess inventory.

So what do you do now.

What do you use hotel tonight as the metaphor.

 \[00:10:46\] What\'s a hotel tonight is basically kind of what we\'re doing only in the kind of travel and hospitality industry right because they sell excess hotel rooms hotel rooms that the hotels themselves can\'t sell through kind of whatever services they use.

Who is eyeing.

Out.

Who\'s buying.

At this point.

So so people like the target demographic of kind of what we\'re looking at or like people like us more like college students those types of folks who are interested in kind of early tech adoption but still don\'t have.

 \[00:11:19\] Or want to have kind of food at a discount and what\'s kind of typical they would buy an individual meal for you know for them and their roommate or or like a parasite or a sandwich or like a half dozen donuts or you know eventually being like the box to Trader Joe\'s or something of the prepared foods counter animal foods you have this running yet.

 \[00:11:41\] So we launched a kind of e-mail proof of concept about two months ago.

Basically we just wanted to test hypotheses if people would actually go into the store if they got that information.

And so we had a subscriber base of maybe like 350 people.

We ran it with six or seven benders and it turned out that they did.

So we had open rates of about 40 percent of our email people actually went into the store per listing was maybe like four or five people per listing so that\'s actually pretty decent given that the quantities were fairly low anyway.

And Joe did you get everything that was listed sold.

So it wasn\'t entirely wasn\'t a hundred percent but some stores were better than other stores based on the items that they were selling.

 \[00:12:22\] So their location or I mean exactly what were the things that sold well and what didn\'t.

 \[00:12:27\] Yeah.

So the things are sold well were like Sahim which is in callsigns and those types of things the things that didn\'t sell well was kind of like.

There was this one bakery that had kind of an evergreen bread deal.

So they knew people knew that this was kind of running every single day.

So they weren\'t kind of incentivized to go in today versus tomorrow versus the next because they knew that was available.

 \[00:12:49\] And it was also a more like residential neighborhood.

People don\'t really work around there.

They\'re like all outworks across.

 \[00:12:55\] So location matter a lot right.

On day.

My sense is that this will be one it is that list still going by the way we still do not know so we found the list to be fairly restrictive and there are a lot of issues with their basic set successful and looked kind of like what we wanted to test but it wasn\'t successful in the sense that users only wanted one e-mail a day but venders are all very different.

Right.

So they all had different closing hours and they all have different abilities to estimate there have been.

So when will you have the mobile app.

So yes.

So actually I just finished wire framing them this morning and we\'re hoping to have it developed in the next two or three weeks which yeah kind of you know and kind of what the move is is we are building this web app now to kind of test our hypotheses around lives listings and kind of location based searches and through searches and then the mobile app will hopefully be able to kind of take that even further.

 \[00:13:50\] With alerts and being able to kind of do location based searches kind of like when you\'re out and about in city and so it might might to two thoughts would be I\'d try to get the mobile app as quickly as possible that when people try to test these things on the Web if it\'s really the sort of thing people want to use on mobile it never works as well.

And you often end up with bad data.

And the other thing would be like.

Hyper focused when you start it like not even a whole specific city but very specific areas and like the specific verticals like Chris Johnson sandwiches that you learned work the product matters a lot.

 \[00:14:25\] Yeah this product matters and density definitely matters as well.

 \[00:14:29\] Yeah and also the types of vendors that we\'re working with we want to make sure at the place that people want to go on a regular basis to that if there is a discount like even more incentivized in.

 \[00:14:38\] Yeah but like making sure that everyone that uses it has a good experience so that they find something that they like and that there\'s something nearby.

And no matter how much you have to limit it to make sure that this first like thousand users really really love it it\'s almost always worth doing.

 \[00:14:52\] How are you going to get all of the sort of people that have this access food to sign up.

Are you just going around and like banging on the door.

 \[00:14:59\] Yes.

Currently it\'s literally the two of us walking around and talking to every coffee shop we can find every sandwich shop.

We have some advisers who we\'ve been working with who are food waste consultants who they work with restaurant chains New York City and they\'ve actually started to recommend us as a potential option.

People have also emailed us saying like hey I worked really closely with like Safeway or Kroger or whatever if and when you\'re ready you know I\'d love to introduce you.

But mostly right now it\'s really just that\'s like having really high touch.

Question Is it.

 \[00:15:28\] What is the plan to get those first thousand users and users to buy.

Yeah.

So for on the user side we got a little bit of press and just kind of through word of mouth.

We were able to grow from about 350 to about 2500 now.

Yeah.

It\'s just people who are kind of like interested in what we\'re doing.

And then in terms of moving forward what we\'re thinking about is is basically thinking about the target populations that we want and a lot of those are on college campuses so working with the college caterer\'s folks that have those kind of connections and then working with students to be student representatives on campus and things like that to kind of get the word out and we think that because there is that density of population on college campuses it makes a lot more sense.

When you describe the product to just someone who finds out about the app.

How do you think about.

Describing it.

 \[00:16:18\] Around waste.

Is it around really great food near you the low cost store.

You know what\'s what has worked and how do you think about it.

 \[00:16:26\] Yeah I think it\'s primarily like really great food at low cost and then secondary to that.

It\'s like what is your social impact like your environmental impact rate for every dollar of food that\'s wasted.

There\'s like five and a half dollars of inputs behind that that are also than wasted in terms of like land use water use sleepetc.

So we\'re also hoping to be able to play that back to both vendors and users in the future.

So with vendors it\'s how much have you save when it comes to trash hauling.

How much have you made on stuff that you otherwise would have had a loss on.

 \[00:16:53\] What\'s the normal discount rate that stuff sells for.

So.

Our average right now is 50 percent.

 \[00:17:00\] Our range that we\'re allowing vendors to discount is around 25 to 75 rate it\'s like lower than 25 customers and I don\'t really have incentive to walk in and then hire the 35 it\'s just like total lottery business.

 \[00:17:11\] So  \[00:17:12\] that\'s kind of what we\'re playing with now and the highest that someone is actually listed for with 60 percent and the lowest was 30 percent.

Yeah.

 \[00:17:19\] That feels about right like there.

Unfortunate we\'re out of time but this sounds bad and I would like to try it.

Thank you.

You guys.

Have to some you guys come a fence.

 \[00:17:48\] All right.

What are you guys doing here.

So we\'re building an app that makes it way less painful for couples to share expenses.

We think with your credit card transactions you can go through refeed and just easily split expenses that way.

 \[00:18:02\] How do you know people need something new for this idea of an existing services.

 \[00:18:06\] So it\'s actually a problem that I\'m personally very familiar with laughter I\'ve just finished with my fiancee for eight years now and over the years I\'ve tried lots of different things.

Initially you know we try to keep a mental tab for you and your Panax that sort of put you broke down because as soon as they go out of sync this creates awkward moments and is prone to conflict.

We all know we tried spreadsheets where they were paid to manage you know we tried Venmo.

Was sort of the fun of the moment and you know changing 50 bucks back and forth free time same day just seems silly.

 \[00:18:39\] But what about something like split wise.

Like what.

What\'s the specific difference or the need here for work.

 \[00:18:43\] Right exactly.

So it\'s just spillways basically you can you can enter IOUs right on the flight.

Basically enter what it\'s for what the amount is and with whom.

The nice thing about linking with your card or debit credit card transactions.

Basically it\'s all there.

All you have to do is tap it.

So that means a big difference for us.

 \[00:19:00\] That\'s.

Can you explain how it works.

And it just sort of the whole sort of user experience.

 \[00:19:05\] Yeah sure.

So basically you sync your credit up from your actions the same way you sync with Entercom all your child coming into a feed and then.

Whichever ones are shared just happened.

And that\'s it.

And then it says at the end of the month whatever settle up and break it you get it gets added to a tab where you can easily see sort of who owes what you can sell to the app.

But interesting thing that we learned from users that even just knowing what the tab is having always be in sync already quite a lot about.

 \[00:19:33\] Yeah that\'s cool.

And certainly couples would be willing to sort of share just the full transaction stream in a way that you might not with a group on Spotify or something.

Is this why was it up early.

 \[00:19:43\] Yeah we\'re currently one thing but what you just said is you don\'t you don\'t get my personal transactions in your field you just get the transactions for you.

You wouldn\'t sign it.

My personal.

You know what I mean.

Right.

So just whatever you click charging.

Exactly.

So we\'re currently in private bedroom but we\'re going to submit at the outset in the next two weeks.

We started working out in January.

One thing that we sort of made a mistake early on was that we wanted to accommodate oh like is this could work for roommates.

This could work for groups that are travelling.

And what really happened was we had all these different ways of using the app and we didn\'t have any one way that was very very good.

So you made a comment to the salutary team about focusing on something very small that a lot of users would actually like.

So about a month ago we made a decision to sort of.

Just simplify the product and focus just on couples and so we feel you know to push out to a lot of people.

 \[00:20:35\] It\'s good to focus the downside of focusing on couples is right.

Just curious what you\'re planning to do is that you there\'s no inherent morality in there either.

You know like it\'s you use it with your partner and that\'s that.

And like it\'s not like something where you\'re sharing it with friends or roommates and brainteaser is that that\'s actually something that we\'ve been going back and forth on.

 \[00:20:57\] During those months.

You know our initial stage is basically you know try to accommodate every use case.

So to see what a beta testers do judging that data and then like focus I think they\'re just Berzina which is too small.

 \[00:21:09\] And you know we\'ve built a part like focus.

But to answer your question.

 \[00:21:14\] So couple the app we were interested to learn from them because they seemed to grow pretty.

 \[00:21:21\] So they were wise the are they are quite right and they have certainly I mean they have managed to grow but they\'ve had to do it in spite of this huge drag which is the sort of lack of it\'s not any here any of our nature.

Did you have couples using it during your beta period.

Yes.

With those like the best users is that why you decided to focus on this.

Yes based basically most of them.

 \[00:21:44\] That used it tend to be couples.

You know.

That was an interesting thing to me because initially I always thought that maybe I was a little.

 \[00:21:52\] Unique maybe or crazy in the way that I dealt with my fantasies fantasies with my my fiancee now and so we did early artlessly we went out and talked to lots of people.

And so while expense sharing may not be something that you flaunt in from your friends.

Usually when you ask them a lot of people go through.

A very stiff and very painful Maniel ways to deal with it.

 \[00:22:13\] Yep.

No I like the hyperfocus.

It\'s definitely good and if you can if you can figure out a way that this is way better for couples then another solution.

And you know I believe you are.

We\'ll figure out some way to grow this dumb one.

I think it\'s just it\'s really important to keep yourselves disciplined too.

Why.

Why do people need this product.

And what are they going to do with this that they haven\'t with others.

It\'s sort of like the you know split bills with friends or roommates or whatever is one of these sort of canonical startup ideas.

I would bet my Seagate\'s 100 applications a year for some version of splitting bills and splitting expenses.

 \[00:22:55\] We funded a bunch and we found that a bunch and I think it\'s it\'s really important to just be very disciplined about what you know like what is what what\'s new about this and why.

Why is this going to work when so many of us feel.

I love the idea of making things as simple as possible.

And I think I\'m actually I don\'t use a lot of these products but I have not heard myself before this idea of pulling your transaction stream.

 \[00:23:23\] And I think that\'s that sounds really cool.

 \[00:23:29\] It might be that you\'ve built this great initial tool to be able to split bills and then you end up kind of adapting it and you know back in.

Know this is kind of like your initial stab your initial beachhead into this and then you figure out well in order to support the roommate scenario than this it\'s so hard you know at the end date for all of these scenarios though you still have this inherent.

Kind of.

 \[00:23:55\] Viral distribution problem or you know how do you acquire users.

This isn\'t one of those things where you can necessarily charge a lot upfront so you can\'t pay for it.

And so you do need some sort of free way whether it\'s PR or some invite flow or you know it\'s just you know almost too difficult to talk just about this in eight minutes.

It\'s a much longer topic.

 \[00:24:18\] But just get users like that.

 \[00:24:19\] The mistake you know you could sort of like there\'s so many different things you could do here and until you get like the first few hundred or a thousand users really above this you end up shooting in the dark.

And when you get people that are really using this like for their daily lives all the time and then like if you in my CV we would tell you like golf and get your first few hundred users and then we can actually give you real advice.

But in the meantime it\'s going to be a lot of guesswork and this very promising idea.

And it\'s really hard to decide what to do about that but I\'m sure you learned a lot in the beta and I\'m just from your friends like if you can\'t get enough users just from your friends your friends are generally pretty obligated to use your products like.

So you can\'t do that in the first just like a few weeks right.

Then you know you have a problem.

But my my my expectation is you\'ll definitely be able to and then don\'t feel bad about like.

Calling them every week and saying how\'s it going what are you using.

What you know what can we do differently.

That is the way that these things working.

So would you say you know.

 \[00:25:23\] Right now should we should we get on the app stores that we can distribute more easily or should we how many users right now again we have about like 40 beta test and then do they use it daily or weekly like what percentage you\'re using it just incorporate it into their lives.

 \[00:25:37\] Of those 40 I\'d say probably about like 25 hours a day.

That\'s a pretty high rate actually actually every regular like every few days that\'s great.

It is.

That\'s what it\'s right on.

Activity rates are one of the most promising things for early stage startups.

It\'s not clear to me that the app store is the most important thing to do right now because like you know you can get a small number of users without it but it would.

It does log around the margins make the whole process a little smoother.

So I would probably do it because it shouldn\'t be that much harder but don\'t expect that to give you a lot of traction.

Okay we\'re unfortunately out of time.

Sadhus shonk-simmons thanks so much.
