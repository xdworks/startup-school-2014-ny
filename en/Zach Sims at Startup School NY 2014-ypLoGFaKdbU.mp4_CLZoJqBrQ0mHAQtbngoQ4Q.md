**Zach Sims at Startup School NY 2014-ypLoGFaKdbU.mp4**  \[00:00:00\] I have a distinct privilege right now to introduce another one of those New York Y Combinator companies.

CEO is co-founder and CEO Zach Sims who started Code Academy.

Yes hopefully I\'ll know about Code Academy If programming is the fluency of this generation.

They are the place they are the global place to learn it since they launched about three years ago.

They have now served I think over 24 million students all over the world in every single country.

Is that true as well as Antarctica.

Presumably we\'re going to hear more about that.

One of the things that\'s really exciting about this is not only was he a drop out from Columbia but yes was that for dropouts or for Columbia.

I\'m not sure but we\'ll say both.

But like so many startup stories you know from the outside it seems really simple really clear I figure something out makes something people want to grow grow grow them before you know you\'re on The Colbert Report which is was there was a great episode but in fact every startup has its own cluster and I hope Zach shares with you the story of the few weeks running up to demo day because Code Academy was anything but a sure thing.

So please give it up for Zach Sims.

 \[00:01:19\] Awesome thank you Alexis.

I didn\'t realize I\'d have to compete with the soccer game today.

Should have interwove and like the score in my presentation.

But anyway my name\'s Zach Sims.

And as Alexis just mentioned I started a company called Code Academy with my co-founder Ryan and we teach people the skills they need to find jobs in the 21st century online.

But as Alexis mentioned it wasn\'t always that way.

So when I go to a talk like this and I sit in the audience I always ask why is that person on stage.

What experiences have they been through that let them stand up and preach to people and what can I learn from that.

And so today I looked at the slate of speakers that\'s here today and saw a lot of pretty awesome names.

You have world class investors you have people who are changing the world with nonprofits and people with super fast growing companies and then I think they needed someone to fill the cliche spot they needed to drop out.

So my story is somewhat similar to what you\'d see on the Social Network the movie that hopefully a lot of you are familiar with but with a lot less Trent Reznor music and a lot less cocaine.

So.

What I hope you guys leave with at the end of today is kind of our story and hopefully a few key lessons you can learn that will tell you some things you can do to eventually one day prepare yourself to start your own company and then a lot of things that we did that you probably shouldn\'t do if you do start your own company and hopefully a couple of fun stories in between.

Because as Alexis said You hear all the time about people who kind of just hit it and it just works.

And I think the story that\'s been told about Code Academy a lot is that we built the actual product a few weeks before Demo Day and launch and had a lot of success but it wasn\'t really that easy.

So I want to go back to 2003 when I really started becoming interested in the Internet and that was the year that the iTunes music store got really big.

They ran the first advertisements for the iTunes music store and somewhat ironically they were headlined byDr.

Dre and so now that\'s all kind of come full circle.

A few years later I got my first iPod in 2003 and I brought it with me everywhere for the first time you could carry a thousand songs in your pocket.

And so I brought it to the gym I brought it on runs and it skipped throughout the runs.

But what I didn\'t have was a way to protect it.

When I dropped it on the ground which happened all the time and as all you know with hard drives dropping them on the ground isn\'t so great.

So I looked online and I tried to find a case that I could use for my iPod and instead of doing what the normal person dies and buying the first one that I saw I realized should just make one myself.

So at the age of 13 in 2003 I emailed a bunch of different iPod case manufacturers across the country and told them that I had the greatest idea ever to build a waterproof iPod case.

I didn\'t tell them that I was 13 and had no idea what I was talking about.

So after around six months of emailing with someone who worked at a big case manufacturer across theU.S.

finally I had something in my hands that had gone from having an idea when I first got the iPod to having something that now protected it everywhere.

And then a couple of weeks later the guy on the other end who worked at the case manufacturer asked to get on the phone with me so we could talk about how we were going to launch and market what we had built.

And so what I thought was really cool was that no one on the Internet knew that I was 13 and in my parents basement.

It\'s really the great equalizer.

The great equalizer that is until you get on the phone with someone and your voice cracks 10 seconds into the phone call.

So.

That relationship was really fruitful until he realized that I was 13.

But what was really empowering about that was that I realized that being young or being somewhere not in New York or in San Francisco didn\'t matter on the internet didn\'t matter that I never built hardware before it didn\'t matter that I didn\'t know what marketing was.

But the Internet allowed me to learn all these things very quickly and to build something that came out of that.

So it was one of the first lessons I learned early on is don\'t know until you try.

And so I started trying pretty early.

So after that first experience kind of kept going back to the question of how do I learn more about the Internet and what I can do with it.

It already seen what an amazing impact it can have on me and people around me.

And so I went to the library and I picked up a book on THP and Miis.

Q L for Dummies.

I went to a shelf and I saw a list full of yellow and black books picked up a few of them that had acronyms I didn\'t quite understand and I figured you know a book for the rest of us we can really sympathize with that.

And I went home and I read a bunch of four Demis books but it never really clicked and I never really built anything with the knowledge that I\'d picked up by reading these books because they didn\'t actually have me working on real projects.

So when I turned 18 I went to Columbia in New York as Alexis mentioned and instead of studying computer science for some reason I decided to study political science.

And I usually try not to mention that but I\'ll tell you guys that secret.

So I went to college and my first semester I tried to find people that were like me that were interested in technology that were interested in startups.

But there was no one.

I asked everyone around me and what are you guys interested in doing with with your future and your careers and half of them told me were definitely not thinking about that we\'re just interested in partying.

And the other half looked at me similarly weirdly and said you know we\'re working in banking consulting.

Obviously like everyone else in New York.

So I was a little discouraged but second semester of my freshman year saw a poster that there was gonna be a talk from someone who I thought was kind of famous in the New York startup scene.

And name is Sam less in and he started a company called Drop Yo.

It was a file sharing company and he was coming and I showed up two hours early for his talk.

I was thinking there\'s gonna be like a packed house.

You know I got there and it was in a really small room but it was in that really nice building.

So I figured like very important person a lot of people are gonna be here.

Sam showed up on time and no one else showed up.

So that was New York in 2008.

It was a world where no one was interested in startups and you got ridiculed and there was no one to talk to you about about working in technology.

And so Sam was the only thing I had.

So I pestered him for the next six months until he finally let me work for him for a summer for free.

And I tutored the essay at night back in Connecticut where I\'m from.

And I sat on the couch and I learned everything I could from what Sam was doing.

I went back to college and I said What can I do next that will help me learn more how we become better than the experience I had at dropping them.

I definitely wasn\'t taking another class on political theory which at that point was interesting but not quite relevant to what I wanted to do after I graduated.

So I got to know a lot of other people in New York who were working in startups and I went to tech crunch disrupt that year and I saw two friends of mine demos something called group me that at the time allowed you to text one phone number.

They created a group chatting application you could send one one text to one number go to like five or six people and they could all text back to that number.

And I thought it was super cool.

The two founders who were friends of mine had been at a music festival the week beforehand and experienced this themselves when they were trying to text and there was no data.

And that for their e-mails to get through and they could text each other and they got lost and then a week later they built something that solve their problem.

That was crazy to me.

And so Grooby went on to be super popular at tech crunch disrupt and I eventually joined them to work on group me when it was just the two of them and me in an apartment with a couple other people and I realized that solving their problem was the key to their early success.

They\'d build something that they needed to use and they figured you know there\'s a lot of people to go to music festivals and there\'s a lot of people that need to communicate and so they build something for themselves.

And so what I had a group me was something that finally my friends believed in and went from you know my friends looking at me as if I had the worst ideas ever to adding them all to a group chat.

And for the first time they thought that something I was involved in was pretty cool.

And then a lot of other people thought it was pretty cool too.

And so we went from nothing in think it was July of 2010 descending hundreds of thousands of messages a day really really quickly.

We hired a team and we came up with it with a sign that pound sign in retrospect a little embarrassing.

 \[00:10:33\] To Alvin\'s fast slide quickly and I realize that you know the most important thing I could do is get a front row seat on the rocket ship you know and watch as group me grew from 2 people to 15 people to 20 people and then less than a year after with stardate it sold to Skype.

 \[00:10:52\] So after that I went back to laughter.

 \[00:10:59\] I went back to college and you know I had such a good experience.

I kind of figured what most people would do is double down and go back and work in startups.

But I fell prey to the peer pressure and I interviewed at banks and consulting firms like everyone else and I realized sitting across the table from all these managing director is there was absolutely nothing I wanted to learn from these people.

Desolately nothing.

I sat there and I regurgitated a discounted cash flow function.

I learned the night beforehand and even doing it in an interview was just massively painful and figured if that was going to be my life for 18 hours a day for two years I should choose something else to do.

 \[00:11:39\] But what I also saw was that the skills that I had learned over the past two and a half years while I was a Columbia weren\'t relevant to what mattered in the job market.

And I saw that all my friends struggled to find jobs.

Two and a friend of mine Ryan at the time was a senior.

And all of his friends were trying to find jobs.

And even though they were they were seniors graduating from Columbia a lot of them still struggle because the skills that they were learning weren\'t immediately practical.

So I talked to Ryan who at the time probably thought I was crazy and said we should fix this.

You know this gap between education and employment and it shouldn\'t be too hard to solve.

I sent him an email on the first e-mail that I think kind of really started the company with this headline.

One other thing that one other thing turned out to be your company.

But we started talking about ways to connect people with skills that would eventually help them find jobs.

And we realized we should just get started.

We had a lot of free time and nights and weekends.

And so we started building a bunch of different ideas.

The first one we\'ve always been really great at namings.

The first one is called Come recruit us I believe.

 \[00:12:51\] I think we had the dotU.S.

domain name.

So we\'re very inventive.

And at the time we figured the best way to connect students with jobs was to have them log in with their Facebook account and just say where they wanted to work.

It seemed pretty simple.

So we built the first version of this in 2011 and we talked to a lot of friends and mentors people who worked at startups before.

And all the people that worked at startups looked at us and said This is the dumbest thing I\'ve ever heard.

We\'re like it\'s OK.

You\'re not the market for this.

So we spoke to our friends a Colombian.

We\'re going to help you get jobs and they all looked at us.

This is the dumbest thing I\'ve ever heard.

It says very very encouraging.

 \[00:13:33\] Horizon and I took that feedback and we said you know well we\'ll roll with this and we\'ll apply to Y Combinator because if no one else thinks our idea is good maybe someone will think it\'s crazy.

 \[00:13:44\] So we filled out a y our Y Combinator application and we asked for some feedback and got some of the best advice I\'ve gotten since we started the company which is we had too many words and not enough information.

And that was probably because we didn\'t really know what we were building ourself and so we just kind of put a lot of words around around a thing in it.

And you know we we applied twice and figured we\'d never ever get in.

Turned out we got an email a couple of weeks later and we were invited to interview.

So we flew out to California and we met with all the partners.

And before doing that we landed went to a coffee shop.

We figured it and put the finishing touches on on the thing that we had built that helped people find jobs through Facebook.

 \[00:14:27\] And we realized on the plane this amount had an epiphany that this is just a horrible idea.

Everyone had been talking to us was absolutely right it was just the worst idea ever you know.

So at the time we figured well we can hold programmers find jobs that\'s a better niche because we were you know I was learning to program myself.

My co-founder was a programmer.

We were doing programming challenges.

So we spent the next 48 hours in a café in San Francisco building a way for people to take programming challenges and then find jobs from there and were so focused on building the first prototype of that product that we didn\'t realize we had locked the keys to or Veon be inside or beN.V.

So we went back that night and didn\'t have a place to stay.

So next morning we showed up at Y Combinator looking a little raggedy and just a total mess and we figured we walked in.

We spoke to the partners for ten minutes and we got question after question but the weird thing was they were answering each other\'s questions so we didn\'t know whether that meant we had a really good idea or a not so good idea and we didn\'t have a chance to demo what we had spent 48 hours building and so on the way out one of the partners tapped us on the shoulders kind of looked at us and said Can you guys even actually program.

Kind of like sheepishly nodded and they they didn\'t ask how well the answer was yes.

So we left and we said well we blew it and we flew out here we had this big shot.

We got a lot of questions and we don\'t even get to answer any of them.

And they don\'t even think we know we\'re doing so which wasn\'t far from the truth at the time.

And so we we went from being on a superhigh before interview to super low walking around Palo Alto.

And then a few hours later Paul Graham called us and said We\'d like to have you for Y Combinator this year.

I think my answer to him on the phone was like This is the wrong number.

How do you do.

Are you serious.

And then I did something smart and I said Can I get back to you which I have no idea what I did when we needed to think about but apparently we did.

So a couple of weeks later we got our first check from my combinator.

So the first feeling of like wow we actually made it.

Know everyone gets into like nominator instantly successful it\'s like pixie dust.

So that\'s what we figured and we moved out to Silicon Valley and we said you know awesome everything set from here on out going to live and work in a sweet office.

You know you see all these pictures of brick in San Francisco and then we get out there and we crash on the floor of a friend\'s apartment who worked a Palantir.

And so this was our office and.

And where we slept for the first couple of weeks until we realized it\'s not productive when your desk is the box for a coffee machine laughter.

 \[00:17:14\] So we moved into our own office.

I felt really warm and cozy.

 \[00:17:18\] This  \[00:17:18\] is our apartment too.

You\'ll notice we were really good at namings so the company\'s name is right Zach is my co-founder his name is Ryan and my name is Zach and we figured like very very inventive.

 \[00:17:30\] You\'ll see this is a recurring theme we\'ll get back to this.

So this was our first office.

And finally we were excited like we\'re doing something right.

We have an office we have an apartment.

Let\'s prove what we\'re doing shouldn\'t be so hard you know.

So we spoke to a bunch of a bunch of startups and we said you know we have a way for you to hire more programmers and they said that is awesome.

The hardest thing we do is hire.

And we can\'t find a way to find people we can\'t find a way to evaluate them.

And so we knew we were on the right track there.

Now we talked to the programmers and we said we have this really awesome thing.

We will help you get jobs and you know just to do it.

You just have to do these fun challenges.

And they had absolutely no interest in what we were building.

Went to a Y Combinator dinner and they were all like you know we just started a company and I see and I still get 50 linked and e-mail requests everyday like why am I going to mess around on your on your garbage platform.

So we went back to the drawing board.

And you\'ll notice this is not the first time we went back to the drawing board.

But this time it wasn\'t just metaphorical and we didn\'t go back to the original concept that we had of helping people learn skills to find jobs.

Instead we basically became random startup idea generators.

So here\'s a few of our ideas you\'ll notice some of them are really good like building a CRM for club promoters luridly if you spun like a jackpot wheel you would not get anything as crazy as what we were coming up with.

So we kind of sat there and were like Well unclear what we\'re doing but we\'re in Y Combinator and we have a hundred seventy thousand dollars so that\'s cool.

And there\'s two of us and we figure we can move in with friends.

We could eat ramen and we would have five years of burn just work on your hands for club promoters all day.

So we were determined.

Not to fail.

And I remember going to office hours with Sam Altman and Sam and called us.

You know the worst the worst ratio of intelligence to ideas.

So smart but such stupid ideas.

 \[00:19:36\] So every night we\'d go home and I\'d sit there and run.

I would write code for one of these ideas and we\'d get super super frustrated both with what we were building.

But for me without a formal programming background I had takenC.S.

one on one when I was a Columbia.

I had read a couple of those for Dummies books.

And Ryan had actually started an organization on campus in Columbia to teach people how to program.

And so in the process I was learning the skills I needed to do my job basically.

And so we started kind of came back to where we started which is can we teach people the most important skill they need to find a job in the 21st century which was programming and we had sort of patient zero which is me if I could learn how to program well then probably a couple older people could use it too.

And this was around 3 to 4 weeks before Demo Day.

At this point.

And so we started building the first version of Code Academy and we spoke to a couple of the partners NYC and some investors and again you\'ll notice this is a common refrain.

They told us it was really stupid.

And a lot of them told us that there were only 100000 employed programmers in the US.

Like there\'s just no market for something that teaches people to program.

People are not interested in programming and never will be.

That was something we heard a couple times.

 \[00:21:01\] But this time you knew something was different.

Ryan and I were super interested in what we were doing mostly because we were building for me and based on Ryan\'s experience.

And so we\'d go home every night worked all the time.

We did some research for some of the fundamental pieces of code Kadam Ryan still tries to convince me that playing Farmville counted as research for how he eventually built the gamification Antica Academy.

 \[00:21:26\] I think he was addicted.

 \[00:21:29\] And then we showed the first version of code academy to a lot of investors and everyone at Y Combinator and the line that people generally use is you should be embarrassed when you launch for the first time.

But what people told us was you should be embarrassed when you launch for the first time.

Not this embarrassed it\'s like you know who Facebook get out was what we were told.

So you know we went back and I played with it a couple times.

 \[00:21:55\] This is made for me and it works for me and I know javascript now.

So we\'re doing something right and I really like the experience.

And this is another thing we learned again as as I learned in the group me instance it\'s much easier when you\'re building for yourself.

All these people we were showing Code Academy.

You didn\'t get it because they knew how to program.

But I didn\'t.

So this was the one of the first early versions of Code Academy.

You know you learn in line learning by doing.

And there\'s no video and no boring books you have to read it\'s all instantaneous feedback.

And so we launched Code Academy and we left we left the apartment.

Right and I bet that there wouldn\'t be more than 50 people on the site at the same time that day and we installed HRP and we left to get bagels.

We got to the bagel store and my phone started going off because there were 1000 people on the site at the same time with something that we had built basically for like me and my mom to use.

 \[00:22:52\] And we noticed stuff like this on Reddit where people just had no idea how to how to program before how to learn this skill and all of a sudden we made it easy for them.

 \[00:23:01\] And that was super super empowering.

Turns out that wasn\'t an isolated case.

This is Ryan with our Torpey dashboard that day you\'ll notice we actually broke the chart it\'s manometer because so many people were on the site at the same time.

And so immediately we basically went from being the least popular company in Y Combinator that summer where you know three weeks beforehand we actually suggested to us that we just not demo Demo Day because you know you don\'t have an idea.

You haven\'t built anything.

It\'s not possible to make anything in three weeks.

Not plausible.

So we built something anyway and we were the fastest growing Y Combinator company at that time.

And this was sort of the bullet point was you know we we taught people to program.

And finally we had the data that millions of people do want to learn programming and we were the answer and this was the slide the two of us used to talk about ourselves.

 \[00:23:53\] Look a little young and we went from having no one to pay attention to us and no one returning our cold e-mails to investors texting me and saying they actually had a dream about Code Academy.

It turns out I thought it like this whole thing was a dream is like we\'re still eating Rahmon and like nothing you know is not possible to a few weeks later we closed our series with the gentleman who just was on stage with Fred and in Union Square Ventures and we moved back to New York and we actually went to an AGM to verify it was like this cannot be real.

Well how is this money in her bank account.

So armed with two and a half million dollars in on cloud nine after raising our series we set about building a company.

But we realized it pays to be a cockroach.

And by that I mean it pays just to not stop and just to not die like we thought everything along the way it tried to kill us.

Right.

Like all of our friends were like startups are dumb.

Your dumb your ideas are dumb.

And we kind of just looked at all of them and said whatever and build Code Academy it pays not to quit.

 \[00:25:07\] So after moving back to New York we thought like we\'re on cloud 9 we have all this money all these people on our Web site.

Turns out that last part was not true because all those people were on our Web site because we were on tech crunch.

And so hopefully some of you are familiar with the Tech Crunch of initiation.

Riegert super popular and then you at the drop of sorrow where everything\'s miserable.

And we had that and we went back and we tried to hot fire find more people to join the team.

We interviewed 100 people before hiring our first person.

That is an exercise in frustration.

So we realized startups really are a roller coaster.

You know we went from getting into Y Combinator and thinking success was a sure thing too.

Two weeks later realizing we didn\'t have an idea to eventually going back to the original idea that we had and finding the right implementation of it.

And the thing is that startups are much easier to deal with when you actually care about what you\'re doing.

So now every morning we wake up read the newspaper and you see that a year after they graduate more than 50 percent ofU.S.

college students are unemployed or underemployed that by 2020 there\'s going to be more than a million open programming jobs.

If education keeps going at the same speed and this is really motivating for us because this is a massive problem because the world companies won\'t grow as fast as they can.

People won\'t have jobs if we don\'t exist.

And to this day in a more than 24 million people have used code academy is something that we started building in our dorm room at Columbia and then built in California and now proudly build in New York.

More than 24 million people have used something that we built.

But what matters most is the stories of the people that use it.

People like Ryan who a year and a half ago had absolutely no idea how to program learned on code academy built an app called circuit that was featured as one of Time\'s best Web sites of 2013.

And then two weeks ago Ryan sold his company.

So he went from knowing absolutely nothing to a year and a half later building a company and a startup in a product and selling it there there\'s people like Amy who at 13 started learning to program on code academy.

And by the time she was 14 the EU and called her the European Digital girl of the year because she spoke all over Europe telling everyone how important programming was for the future.

So hopefully a couple of things you guys will take away from today\'s talk.

First you shouldn\'t make excuses to get started.

It\'s really simple.

You have the internet which is the biggest distribution engine ever and the tools is all you need is a web browser and a text editor should optimize everything you do for learning.

You get a front row seat on a rocket ship so you know what it\'s like to build a company and we\'re hiring if you want us to be that rocket ship.

You should realize that startups are a roller coaster and you should never ever give up.

And lastly you should be passionate about what you\'re working on because that will make all the difference.

Maybe the most important thing I\'ve learned after doing this for a few years and speaking a few times and speaking with a couple other people that speak is that everyone here has no idea what they\'re doing.

And so even as you get further along and you build a startup you realize that startups are hard and there are new challenges at every step along the way.

So despite the fact that none of us quite know what we\'re doing yet you don\'t know until you try.

So thank you.
