And the first start of school is jism Y Combinator history that was up in Boston and I was lucky enough to participate in it.

学校的第一个开始是Jism Y Combinator的历史，当时在波士顿，我很幸运地参加了这次活动。

My co-founder and I Steve Hoffman I\'m Alexa\'s my co-founder and I Steve started Reddit and we were at the very first start of school and trust me Hawai see was just begging people to come and show up.

我和我的共同创始人史蒂夫·霍夫曼，我是亚历克莎，我是我的联合创始人，我是史蒂夫创办Reddit的，我们刚开始上学，相信我，夏威夷西只是乞求人们来看看。

This was such a new thing this new idea.

这是一个很新的东西-这个新想法。

Back in 0 5 about helping you know early stage founders just get insight from their peers from people who are doing it and have done it in a way that was approachable in a way that was helpful and in a room full of people who are all actually doing great stuff.

回到05年，帮助你认识早期的创始人，只是从那些正在做这件事的人那里获得他们的同事的洞察力，并以一种可以平易近人、乐于助人的方式去做，在一个满屋子都在做着伟大事情的人的房间里。

We don\'t want to have seen stories we don\'t want to have people who are just sort of talking about doing startups who want to be with people who are doing it and so know that you\'re in a really special audience right now right.

我们不想看到故事，我们不想让那些谈论创业的人，他们想和正在做的人在一起，所以知道你现在一个非常特别的观众中。

Everyone around you look to your left to your right during all the breaks.

在所有的休息时间里，你周围的每个人都往左看，向右看。

These are all people doing cool stuff.

这些人都在做很酷的事。

So please take advantage of the discussions you\'ll have here during the intermissions just as much as you\'ll enjoy the talks you\'ll hear on stage.

因此，请充分利用在休会期间你将在这里进行的讨论，就像你将在舞台上听到的演讲一样。

This is exciting and I know I know a lot of you have decided to come out in spite of the fact the World Cup is going on right now which is important I wonder about your priorities.

这是令人兴奋的，我知道很多人已经决定出来，尽管世界杯正在进行，这是很重要的，我想知道你们的优先事项。

But clearly the right kind of founders and just so you know I think Chilla is still up on Spain 1 0.

但显然是正确的创建者，我认为奇拉仍然在西班牙10强。

I don\'t know how you guys feel about that.

我不知道你们是怎么想的。

Rezvan upset some very happy Shawlands here but we\'ll see what happens.

雷兹文在这里惹恼了一些非常快乐的肖兰德，但我们会看到结果的。

But look I just wanted to point out one of the thing you know we\'re also like you have to have I think it\'s there are now 28 Y Combinator companies that are based here in New York.

但听着，我只想指出一件事，你知道，我们也像你一样，我认为现在有28家Y组合公司总部设在纽约。

And this is kind of exciting we\'ve got companies let\'s see here we gotta anarchist hacker school one month rails valuable rant hop we\'ve Rockett trip and I think Teek on US year from Passon scribbles.

这是一种令人兴奋的，我们有公司，让我们看看这里，我们有无政府主义的黑客学校，一个月的Rails，有价值的咆哮，我们的火箭之旅，我认为Teek在美国年从帕森涂鸦。

These are all members of the Lycee family who spent three months out in the valley.

这些都是莱塞家族的成员，他们在山谷里呆了三个月。

They worked on their company as they did why they took advantage of all the sort of Silicon Valley Network and then they came back here to grow their companies and that is awesome because obviously our food is better because obviously the quality of life here is better and because obviously this is one of the greatest cities in the world.

他们在自己的公司工作，就像他们为什么利用所有的硅谷网络，然后他们回到这里来发展他们的公司，这是很棒的，因为很明显，我们的食物更好，因为这里的生活质量很明显更好，而且很明显这是世界上最伟大的城市之一。

And so I\'m happy you guys are all here.

所以我很高兴你们都在这里。

I\'m still happy Startup School is here and I hope the rest of this afternoon is viable and entertaining for you all as I know it will be for me.

我仍然很高兴创业学校在这里，我希望今天下午剩下的时间对你们来说是可行的和有趣的，因为我知道这对我来说是可行的。

And so you know I have one other thing that I wanted to mention and this is something I made sure I got my notes here yep this is something that I cannot stress enough.

所以你知道，我还有一件事我想提一下，这是我确保我在这里得到我的笔记的东西，是的，这是我无法强调的东西。

I\'ve just gotten done in 80 university tour across the country.

我刚刚完成了80次全国大学之旅。

All right I got to visit 80 universities and Canada Arhat to the north.

好吧，我去了北方的80所大学和加拿大。

Yes Canada and I\'ve seen first hand the fact that entrepreneurship is alive and well and students are taking it upon themselves to just start building and start learning and start coding and this is crazy to me because nine years ago I would have killed for any ounce of this kind of energy.

是的，加拿大和我亲眼目睹了创业精神还很活跃的事实，而学生们开始建设，开始学习，开始编码，这对我来说是很疯狂的，因为九年前，我会为了任何一盎司的这种能量而杀人。

Back when I was just an undergrad at UVA getting Reddit started and I can assure you some people here in this audience are going to go on to do amazing world changing things so be nice to everyone but also take full advantage of this moment.

回到我在UVA大学读本科的时候，我可以向你们保证，在座的一些人会继续做一些令人惊叹的事情，改变世界，所以要善待每个人，同时也要充分利用这一时刻。

We are so lucky to be talking about this stuff right.

我们很幸运能正确地谈论这件事。

We are so lucky to be sitting in a nice air conditioned auditorium talking about these amazing opportunities we have because of the new economy because of technology and because if you want to change the world you know in the internet age you don\'t need open a factory you just need to open a laptop.

我们很幸运地坐在一个舒适的空调礼堂里，谈论着我们拥有的这些令人惊奇的机会，因为新的经济，因为科技，以及如果你想改变世界，你知道，在互联网时代，你不需要开一家工厂，你只需要打开一台笔记本电脑。

Right.

右（边），正确的

That\'s a really big deal and we\'re really lucky to be here taking advantage of it.


这真的是件大事，我们很幸运能在这里利用它。
